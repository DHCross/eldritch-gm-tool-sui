Foreword

Eldritch 2nd Edition expands on its predecessors, Eldritch RPG 1st Edition and Revised, while adopting the later-developed Plyphyny multi-genre system. It streamlines gameplay, emphasizing narrative and swift action, while preserving innovative mechanics and introducing more options and detail. This edition melds core rules with the rich Ainerêve setting within the fantasy genre called The Eldritch Realms. A separate free player's handbook is also available which provides easy access to the essentials. 

The game is story- and action-focused rather than tactical or “realistic.” The rules encourage immersion where everybody gets into the storytelling groove. They allow tremendous flexibility in the creation of unique characters. Although the book presents packages to build races and character classes common to epic fantasy, players will find it easy to build their characters with any imaginable combination of skills and background.

Players are not forced into strict archetypes but can choose from character classes as presented in whole or part, or may make up their own concept in collaboration with the Game Master. Furthermore, no rolled personality traits or moral “alignment” dictates the players’ choices in gameplay. 

As such, player character personalities and talents evolve organically over time. Heroes start powerful yet are vulnerable without good teamwork, and the same goes for villains and monsters. The Game Master (GM) will find that improvising random encounters or implementing ideas during play is easy.

The realms of Eldritch showcase the tropes of fantasy and the epic fantasy milieu as a familiar sandbox while allowing the GM to personalize the experience. 

Ainerêve is the official setting for the game and further expands player choices with an exciting setting for the GM to use, written by Peter Schaefer, Jon Creffield, and Dan Cross.

Miniatures and a battle mat are not needed, and narrative is emphasized, but the game is not diceless. It may look like a lot to learn at first, but once the mechanics are understood, they serve the story and fade into the background. 

Once familiar with the basic rules, the GM can drop improvised events or opponents into the action without a single reference to this book’s pages.

Some role-playing terms are probably known to most people these days, but a full list of both common terms and those unique to Eldritch are defined in the glossary in this book in case you find something unfamiliar.

Player’s Introduction

Eldritch is a fantasy role-playing game, a social pastime where players assume the roles of characters seeking adventure together in an imaginary world. In fantasy, this will be a world of warriors and wizards, dwarves and dragons, magic and treasure. The Game Master (GM) describes the situations that the characters experience. The players tell him what their characters want to do, and the GM adjudicates the results of their actions impartially using the game rules and common sense. The game proceeds like an interactive story or screenplay where you choose the path to take.

Players do not need to know all the rules; the GM takes care of that. It does help to have a grasp of the basic game concepts and mechanics, though, so that you can make better choices. That is what the next section covers. Later chapters go into more detail, and cover special cases, elaborations, and extra rules.

Dice galore

Polyhedral dice are a staple of role-playing games used to generate numbers in certain ranges to determine various outcomes. In Eldritch, dice are not only rolled to produce random numbers, but are used to define proficiency in a skill, the protective value of armor, or the difficulty of a challenge or casting a magic spell. The maximum value that can be rolled on a die or dice for a skill defines several values in the game as well, such as a character’s ability to survive combat. Standard dice notation uses “d” then the number of sides, such as d6 for a six-sided die. d4+d8 means the sum of a four-sided and an eight-sided die, 3d6 means the sum of three d6s, and so on.

Character

In Eldritch you provide the personality and motivation of the character you play in the game. What your character can do well in game terms is defined by his or her skills — whether brandishing a bloody broadsword or wielding mighty magics. These skills are chosen at character creation and gained or improved through play. Eldritch offers bundles of skills and traits (advantages and flaws) that define common fantasy races and classes for fast character creation. Simply choose a race and class then modify the skill set to suit the character. Once familiar with the game, you may want to opt for a custom character with whatever skills you think suit the concept (if the GM agrees!).

Abilities

In Eldritch, skills are divided into three basic abilities, each of which has three specialties. Your proficiency in either is rated by die rank, from d4 up to d12. When attempting an action, you roll the dice suited to the task, from a basic d4 if you have minimal skill in that area up to d12+d12 if you are fantastically talented. There are also two focus areas for each specialty that add a bonus if they apply. The ability + specialty + focus applied to a task is called an ability branch. Generally, the value thus rolled is compared to another rolled value that depends on the nature of the challenge or the opposed skill of a foe. If you get an equal or higher result, you succeed. Eldritch abilities, specialties, and focuses are as generic as possible to cover the widest possible range of actions, rather than having a huge list of specific skills. They are supplemented by unique skills called feats that are usually restricted to a class and have special rules.

Character Points and Levels

Character points (CPs) are used to buy or upgrade skills, both in character creation and as a campaign progresses. They are gained by adventuring. Character levels are a measure of the character’s overall capability and depend on the CP total.

Combat

Eldritch combat is divided into rounds (of about 10 seconds). Attacks within a round usually take place in order of the basic Prowess ability, highest first. The attacker rolls dice for the ability tree that applies to the attack form. The value is the potential harm (threat points) that could be inflicted. Shield and armor can negate some or all of the potential harm. The defender can choose active defense (subsuming dodge, parry, etc.) to negate more threat points until too fatigued in that combat. The defender’s passive defense is affected last. This is how much punishment the character can take before falling unconscious, at zero hit points, or dying, at a negative number equal to the basic Fortitude ability. Active and passive defenses are the sum of maximum values of several abilities and specialties, defined in the Character Creation chapter.

Magic

In most cases, only the Gift of Magic advantage lets one cast spells in the game. Practitioners of magic fall into two categories, as defined by their focus: magic-wielder (using magic from arcane sources) and theurgist (using magic granted by the gods). By default, a magic-using character can learn only spells of his own level or lower, so a Level 1 mage could normally only learn Level 1 (Common) spells (from any path). You can spend character points to overcome this limitation. Known spells and their descriptions are listed in the Magic chapter. Once familiar with the game, you can use the full magic rules to have your character create unique spells and magic items.

Equipment

All characters begin play with equipment appropriate to the life of an adventurer. This includes backpacks, bedrolls, belt pouches, utility daggers, flint & tinder, lanterns (and oil), parchment or paper, a pack mule, and rations that will last a week. Also, sacks, torches, water skins, whetstones, and wooden poles. There is more detail in the short equipment section in Chapter 1.

Money

Monetary transactions in the game world use a system like our modern-day currency; simply substitute some number of “coins” or “crowns” for dollars. Assign dollar amounts to items that would be comparable to things in our own world. For example, renting a car is not unlike renting a horse in the medieval context, so charge 50 crowns a day for a good horse. 

Imagine what something is worth today, and pretend that translates into the fantasy economy, making all conversions easy and fun, even if unrealistic. Coins weigh an ounce each unless the GM decides otherwise. $1 is roughly equivalent to 10 copper coins; $50 is roughly equivalent to 5 silver coins; $500 is roughly equivalent to 1 gold coin.

Glossary

Some terms are nearly universal to role-playing games (PC, NPC, GM, etc.). This book uses these terms in the conventional sense (defined below for new gamers). Other terms and acronyms are unique to the Eldritch Role Playing System. By all means read this glossary, but it is mainly there for when you find a term puzzling in context in the main body of the rules.

**Ability:** Any skill or trait possessed by a creature. Most often one of the three basic abilities: Competence, Prowess, and Fortitude. 

**Ability branch:** A single branch of an ability tree: the ability + specialty + focus applied to a task. A test is made using such a branch and can incorporate at most one die for the basic tier, one die for the specialty, and a bonus for one focus.

**Ability test:** Most actions use this resolution system to determine an outcome. A creature’s effort may involve a physical ability or a test of skill; the challenge may come from the nature of the action or active opposition. A test uses one chosen ability branch, with up to two dice rolled by the player to try to meet or exceed the result of the GM’s challenge die roll. See Challenge die.

**Ability tree:** The basic ability rank plus all its branches. Each basic ability (1st tier) has three specialties (2nd tier), and each specialty has two focuses (3rd tier).

**Advantages:** These are useful traits not covered by standard abilities. They tend to be something the character purchases only at the time of character creation. Each advantage usually costs 1 to 3 character points or 1 to 2 CPs per level for advantages broken into levels. Some advantages are specific to mythical creatures, and some rare advantages may be obtained while adventuring.

**Battle phase:** Part of a combat round. A combat round lasts roughly 10 seconds, divided into five 2-second battle phases. Combatants act in descending order of basic Prowess ability, fastest to slowest, from d12 (first, in phase 1) down to d4 (last, in phase 5). 

**Branch Rank:** This useful general guideline is a character’s level of proficiency or power in a single ability branch, determined by adding up the max-value of all of the die ranks in the branch.

**Branch ranks are as follows:**

**Weak:** 1–3

**Average:** 4+

**Respectable:** 12+

**Skilled:** 16+

**Great:** 20+

**Phenomenal:** 24+.

**Challenge:** The die rank of a test, rolled by the GM against the player character’s action, ranging from d4 through d12 depending on the nature of the challenge. The GM may modify this for unusually difficult situations, adding another die of equal die rank for disadvantage. The player’s roll must equal or beat the GM’s to succeed.

**Challenge die levels:** Easy: d4, Moderate: d6, Difficult: d8, Demanding: d10, Formidable: d12.

**Character class:** Each character in Eldritch is constructed by combining a race and an occupational class typifying one of many adventurers of the land.

**Character points (CPs):** Points used to build up a character’s abilities. All Player-Adventurer characters begin with 10 points for customization after race and class selection. Players can earn points for involvement, good play, and in-game achievements every time the game is played. Earned CPs are used to buy or upgrade skills.

**Class level:** Class level measures overall capability, measured by the total number of character points possessed. Each level increases the character’s proficiency at his or her class feats.

**Combat statistics:** The rolling of dice and various number scores simulate combat, representing offensive and defensive actions and resilience against harm. 

Different sizes of polyhedral dice representing different abilities are rolled to determine the outcome of attack actions and to calculate defenses. The defense pools are scores derived from abilities, each consisting of a number of hit points. See Die rank, Ability test, and Defense pool.

**Damage reduction (DR):** Armor and shields grant damage reduction in addition to the ablative hit point-based defense pools. Shields reduce threat points by 1 to 3 points (depending on shield type) before the chosen active defense is reduced. The armor reduces threat points that exceed the defender’s active defense by a die roll depending on the armor type.

**Defense pool (DP):** A defense pool is one of two calculated numbers used to mitigate or negate threat points. The active defense pool is the maximum value of Prowess + Agility + Melee. The passive defense pool is the maximum value of Fortitude + Endurance + Strength. For example, a warrior with d8 Prowess, d6 Agility, and d8 Melee would have an Active DP of 22.

**Defense, active:** All willful and reflexive defensive actions taken by a combatant, such as parrying, sidestepping, or dodging. This first line of defense uses the active defense pool, which is rapidly depleted in combat (simulating fatigue) but is just as rapidly refreshed once combat ends. Shields are treated as a form of active defense when readied.

**Defense, passive:** Any protection afforded to a creature without conscious activation or effort. This includes armor and the passive defense pool. The hit points of harm accrued by the passive defense represent actual damage to mind, body, and soul, and are slow to heal.

**Die rank:** This is the die type itself, referring to the maximum value it can roll, usually equal to the number of its faces: d3 (below average), d4 (average human; default basic rank), d6, d8, d10, d12 (the highest rank for standard characters), and d14, d16, d18, and d20 (special monsters). Die rank refers only to the value of a single die of any ability tree tier.

**Energy points:** Most activatable magic items use stored energy points.

**Feats:** Maneuvers, powers, and spell-like abilities unique to each character class.

**Focus ability:** The third and most specific tier of an ability tree. Each specialty has two focuses. Where a focus applies, it grants a fixed bonus for a test, or to potential harm or initiative when attacking.

**Focus Item:** Focus Items are special items in Eldritch RPG that can be possessed by characters, including Spell, Battle, and Inspirational Foci. Spell Foci channel and condense magical energy, while Battle Foci are used in close combat for critical attacks. Inspirational Foci can be any item of sentimental or historical significance that aids spellcasting success. 

**GM (Game Master):** This person runs the game and has the final say over how actions are resolved.

**Harm:** See Potential harm.

**Hit points:** Hit points represent how much potential harm a character or creature in the game can mitigate, negate, or absorb before being killed. See Defense pool for how this works.

**Iconic Items:** Iconic Items are special items that can be possessed by characters. There are three types: Iconic Weapons, Magic Foci, and Inspirational Items. They aid characters in their abilities and spells through their mastery die bonuses. Characters may change which item they designate as their iconic weapon, spell focus, or inspiring object once per level.

**Maintenance penalty:** Maintaining a spell past the first round imposes a penalty of 1 to 5 on other tests (except attack rolls and resultant threat points) while concentrating on prolonging the magical effect. Maintaining more than one spell imposes a penalty for each such spell.

**Mastery die (MD):** A character may be able to add a mastery die to the roll when attempting a class feat or a chosen path spell, allowing up to three dice rolled before the focus bonus (if applicable) during a test. The die rank increases with level (d4 through d12). This mastery die can be used a limited number of times per day in combat or challenging noncombat situations. Any use beyond those limits costs a number of spirit points equal to the mastery die rank (see Spirit Points).

**Maximum value (Max-value or MV):** Each rank has a corresponding die type, as explained under die rank. The max-value of each die is simply the highest roll possible. Thus, the max-value of d4 is 4, of d6 is 6, d8 is 8, d10 is 10, and d12 is 12.

**NPC (Non-Player Character):** Any character controlled by the GM and not a player.

**Opposed roll (contested challenge):** Tests in the Eldritch RPG are resolved by rolling a die (or dice) and comparing the result to an opposing die roll (the challenge die or an opponent’s roll); the higher result wins, with the defender winning a tie. 

Opposed rolls are used in any contest of skill against an active, living opponent (contested roll), or when making a test to overcome a situational challenge using a skill or trait, or to cast a spell. Attack actions are handled differently; see Potential harm.

**PA (Player-Adventurer):** A character in the game who is controlled by one of the players. Also referred to as a Player Character (PC). 

**Potential harm (attack roll):** A dice roll that generates threat points against one or more targets. A potential harm roll is not an opposed roll. Instead, threat points ablate the target’s chosen defense pools until the attack penetrates armor, hitting the body and causing actual harm.

**Prowess (initiative):** Prowess determines the order of actions during a combat round. Each character’s turn in battle is determined primarily by his or her Prowess rank, sometimes modified by weapon bonuses or other class-based or magical factors. The final, modified number presents the character’s initiative score for that round. See Battle phase.

**Rank:** Level of skill, effect, etc. See Branch rank, Die rank.

**Saving throw:** Some spells, innate powers, and special combat feats allow an opposed roll by the opponent. PCs and NPCs use whatever ability is needed, adding together the rolls for each die in the ability branch. Other creatures are assigned a saving throw rank, a die or die combination that applies to every situation requiring an opposed roll.

**Specialty:** The second tier of an ability tree. Each ability has three specialties. In situations where a specialty applies, it adds an extra die to the ability die.

**Spirit points:** These represent a character’s inner strength, hidden reserves, and luck. Characters can use spirit point actions to gain an inspired advantage in combat, fuel a complex magical feat or power, quickly recuperate during battle, cast spells without training, and invoke impromptu spells outside of one’s spell repertoire, or activate magic items.

**Static bonus:** A number from +1 through +5 added to a potential harm roll or test.

**Status effect:** Any condition caused by an affliction spell, power, or special feat. Some status effects other than afflictions can be beneficial.

**Threat points:** This refers to the potential harm possible from rolling the dice in a specific ability branch.

Chapter 1: Characters

To play the game, you need a character whose role you assume. This can be any fantasy type in Eldritch—a knight in shining armor, a sage grey-bearded wizard, a nimble thief, a doughty dwarf warrior, a graceful elven archer—anything that fits the milieu. Eldritch offers standard fantasy race and class packages for quick character creation, but you can create your own or with the GM once you understand how the game works. (Custom races and classes are discussed in the Game Master’s section).

To create your character, first get an Eldritch character sheet. Copy the one in these rules or download one from **plyphyny.com** (the official website of Crossroads Games). Come up with a general idea for the character. Then follow the steps below, referring to later details as necessary, and filling out the character sheet as you go. 

Character Points 

When creating a character in Eldritch RPG, 2nd Edition, aim for a well-rounded character with abilities from different branches. Basic abilities and specialties are ranked on a scale of d4 to d12, indicating the character's experience and training.

Characters automatically start with a d4 in Competence, Prowess, and Fortitude. These starting values are worth 12 Character Points (CPs) but are assigned for free. 

Begin by choosing your race and class. Each race and class provides a bundle of skills, advantages, and feats, along with automatic minimum die ranks and focus bonuses.

After selecting your race and class, you receive 10 CPs to further customize your character. Use these CPs to increase abilities and specialties. It costs CPs equal to the maximum value of the next die rank to increase a basic ability or specialty one step. 

For example, moving from d4 to d6 costs 6 CPs. Focuses grant a static bonus of +1 to +5 and cost 4 CPs per level. Purchase both the basic skill and one of its specialties to increase your average dice roll results. You can choose one of the available focuses for a specialty to tailer your character to what you envision. 

There is no restriction on a specialty being higher in die rank than its associated basic ability, allowing you to focus on specific aspects of a broader skill. Flaws are optional but can provide extra CPs for further customization of your character.

Character Level

Character level represents a full-fledged character’s overall capability, determined by the total number of character points earned. New characters start at 10 CPs, reflecting the points for initial customization, to give them a slight starting boost.

Level, CPs, and Mastery Die

**Level 1:** 10 to 100 CPs [Mastery d4]

**Level 2:** 101 to 199 CPs [Mastery d6]

**Level 3:** 200 to 299 CPs[Mastery d8]

**Level 4:** 300 to 399 CPs [Mastery d10]

**Level 5:** 400 to 500+ CPs [Mastery d12]

All characters are granted the use of a mastery die, a roll that adds to an ability test during combat or suspenseful situations. Its increasing die rank represents the rising power and skill of the adventurer at each level. The mastery die is limited in use, invoked during crucial times of great adversity, highlighting moments of great heroism or aptitude.

Character Creation Steps

**Step 1—Choose Race/Species and Ethnic Background:** Select the character’s species and ethnic background if relevant in the campaign, noting any advantages, flaws, sex, and age, and enter the minimum die ranks of listed abilities on the character sheet.

**Step 2—Choose Character Class:** Choose your character class and enter the minimum die ranks of listed abilities on the character sheet, unless the die rank was already higher because of the race selection. If a new player, you will see some terms in the class listing you may not understand; do not worry about deciphering rules at this stage. 

**Step 3—Advantages & Flaws:** Advantages cost CPs, usually a fixed amount, but sometimes at a cost per increment, so you can increase that benefit for a certain number of CPs per stage. The bonus character points granted by flaws are already figured into the costs for races, but choosing extra flaws lets you gain more CPs to spend on other things. 

**Step 4—Calculate Defense Scores:** Your defense pools and spirit points are derived from the maximum values for ability and one or more specialties. Enter the values on the character sheet. 

**The Active defense** hit point pool = _Prowess +_ Agility + Melee MV.

**The Passive defense** hit point pool = Fortitude + Endurance + Strength MV 

**Spirit Points** = Competence + Willpower MV. 

**Step 5—Refine Character Concept:** After those four steps, it is time to flesh out the narrative concept with input from the GM, and choose appropriate equipment for your character’s adventuring life.

**Duplicate Ability Ranks and Advantages:** When selecting a race and class combination, duplicate minimum die-ranks in abilities or named advantages listed for both can trigger a benefit, granting an extra 2-point advantage or tiering up an already possessed one. However, die-rank duplicates cannot increase ability branches, and the benefit can only be triggered once during character creation, regardless of the number of matches. Players may choose to swap a duplicate advantage for another of equal or lesser value, but any character point difference is lost.

1. Fantasy Races  

**Humans:** Ainerêve’s most adaptable race is humans, reflecting real-world cultures and societies. From the bustling cities of Maedoen and Psarmorum to the frontier settlements of Dalmavand and the Northern Reaches, they are found everywhere. Their resourcefulness, ingenuity, and survival skills influence history across the realms .

**Norse-inspired Dwarves:** Dwarves are crafty and resilient. These short, muscular humanoids are skilled miners and smiths who thrive in the harsh mountains and deep underground caverns of Grimsete and the Northern Reaches, as well as within the Sechdraic Mountains of Dalmavand. They are known for their resistance to poison and elements, perfect night vision, and martial combat skills .

**Elves:** The Seelie elves, under Oberon’s rule, embody elven grace, wisdom, and a symbiosis with nature. The Unseelie elves, ruled by Mab, exemplify dark magic and necromancy. The Cresylvadran elves have a deep connection to Echoes Forest and a sacred covenant with a powerful spirit called the Sylvadran. The Woodshades, corrupted descendants of elves, represent the forest’s darker legacy. They are skilled warriors due to their agility, magic resistance, and martial weapon skills. Note that all types of alfar are generally hated in Psarmorum .

**Gnomes:** European folklore depicts small, clever gnomes as smart and curious. Their superior low-light vision helps them build intricate underworld homes in Crossroads and Psarmorum’s labyrinthine corridors filled with magical technology. Despite their ingenuity, gnomes face hostility in Psarmorum. 

**Half-elves:** Born from human-elf unions, half-elves represent cooperation and diversity. In the multicultural cities of Maedoen and Crossroads, they combine the agility and magical resilience of elves with the endurance of humans, merging the best of both races. Their presence in Ainerêve suggests cross-cultural harmony.

**Half-orcs:** Born from orcs and humans, half-orcs exist between savagery and civilization. Taller and stronger than humans, they have green skin and tusks. Mostly found in Grimsete’s borderlands and as mercenaries in Crossroads’ bustling cities, their endurance and prowess make them great guards and foot soldiers, but they struggle with social acceptance.

**Halflings:** Small humans with childlike faces but mature bodies, halflings are mischievous and roguish. They thrive in both rural and urban areas, especially in Crossroads and the villages of the Fertile Glens, as well as in Avinoble. They bring whimsy and cunning to Ainerêve, emulating the halflings of classic fantasy role-playing games .

**Drakkin:** The Drakkin are powerful humanoid offspring of dragons and various sapient creatures. These beings inhabit the mystical Verdant Expanse and the remote areas of Castle Astalch. They are powerful fighters due to their magical breath weapons and scaly hides, making them formidable in combat. In regions where they guard mystical artifacts and sacred sites, their draconic heritage is revered and feared.

Dwarves are short, muscular, bearded humanoids, usually four to five feet tall but as wide at the shoulders as a man. They are renowned as miners and smiths, and notorious for their love of gold. 

Dwarves have resistance to poison and the elements, and all have perfect Night Vision. All dwarves train in some form of martial weapon, usually axes or bludgeons.

**Base die ranks:** Fortitude d8 → Endurance d4. Prowess d6 → Melee d6. 

**Advantages:** Night Vision, Strong-willed, Sense of Direction.

Elves appear as slender, fine-featured humans, but have pointed ears, heightened agility, and greater resistance to magic. All elves have some innate ability in the magic arts and have at least one rank in such a skill. 

Most train in some form of martial weapon, usually (beautifully crafted) swords and (high-quality, ornate) bows. They are fleet of foot and can see well in low- light conditions. Elves tend to be either aloof and haughty, or fun-loving and frivolous, depending on their clan or bloodline.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6 → Expertise d6 → Wizardry (+1). Prowess d4→ Agility d4 → Reaction (+1). 

**Advantages:** Night Vision, Gift of Magic, Magic Resistance (+1).

Gnomes are a species of small, misshapen, dwarf-like beings who dwell underground. They are observant, possess superb low-light vision, and tend to be highly intelligent. 

Stubborn, crafty, and swift on their feet when confronted by superior foes, gnomes are an ingenious race, building some of the most intricate underworld homes, typically full of labyrinthine corridors and unusual magical technology.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d4 → Adroitness d6 + Expertise d6 + Perception d4 → Perspicacity (+1).

**Advantages:** Eidetic Memory, Low-Light Vision, Observant.

**Flaw:** Restriction: small weapons only.

The union between humans and elves confers greater agility and resistance to magic than is usual for humans and greater endurance than is usual for elves. 

Half-elves tend to be shorter than the average human, with slightly pointed ears. All half-elves have Low-light Vision.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6. Prowess d6 → Agility d4. Fortitude d4 → Endurance d4 + Willpower d4.

**Advantages:** Heightened Senses, Low-Light Vision, Magic Resistance (+1).The result of a union between an orc and a human, these demi-humans are usually larger and stronger than average humans and, like orcs, are green-skinned with tusks protruding from their lower jaw. 

They are prized as guards and foot soldiers for their natural endurance and prowess despite having the flaw of being ugly (by human standards).

**Base die ranks:** Fortitude d6 → Strength d8 → Ferocity (+1) + Endurance d6.

**Advantages:** Low-light Vision, Intimidation, Menacing. 

**Flaw:** Ugliness.These short humanoids are not disproportionate in their physical features despite their small size. 

Halflings are almost child-like in appearance, having round faces and bright almond-shaped eyes, but the adults have unmistakably mature physiques. Halflings are generally mischievous and roguish.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6 → Adroitness d6 → Cleverness (+1). Fortitude d6 → Willpower d4 → Courage (+1). 

**Advantages:** Low Light Vision, Read Emotions, Resilient. 

**Flaw:** Restriction: small weapons only.

Homo sapiens, the most recognizable primates of any fantasy world, usually enjoy military supremacy because of their tenacity, fecundity, and penchant for war. 

Humans are usually the most influential sentient creatures globally, owing to their resourcefulness, resolve, supreme inventiveness, and incredible knack for survival against all odds.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6. Prowess d6 → Melee d4. → Threat (+1). Fortitude d4 → Willpower d6. 

**Advantages:** Fortunate, Survival.

The powerful Drakkin are the humanoid children of myriad sapient creatures mating with shape-shifting dragons. The dragon’s humanoid offspring are not winged shapeshifters like a full dragon but are nevertheless strong and diverse in capabilities. Draconic ancestry remains unmistakable, with their inheritance of a magical breath weapon and scaly hides providing a natural 1d4 armor (added to any being worn). 

A Drakkin’s breath weapon inflicts potential harm equal to the twisted branch of Prowess + Fortitude + Ferocity: A steam up to 2 feet wide reaching 10 ×basic tier of Fortitude die rank. Choices at character creation include fire, electricity, ice, blasts of air, or sonic energy. 

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6. Prowess d6. Fortitude d6 → Endurance d6 + Strength d4.

**Advantages:** Natural Armor, Breath Weapon, Night Vision.

2. Character Classes

In the Eldritch RPG, heroes from diverse backgrounds embody unique abilities and roles, grouped into four primary categories: Warcraft, Wizardry, Skullduggery, and Theurgy. The core player classes include Adept, Assassin, Barbarian, Mystic, Rogue, Theurgist, and Warrior, presented in alphabetical order for easy reference.

Warcraft

**Warrior:** Skilled fighters and defenders of the realm, specializing in various weapon types, maneuvers, and strategies. They are resilient and resistant to magic.

**Barbarian:** Savage warriors driven by relentless ferocity, masters of primal instincts and devastating attacks.

Wizardry

**Mage:** Practitioners of ancient and reality-altering spells, masters of Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or Sorcery. They are proficient in Wizardry spells, Arcane Finesse, and Dweomercraft.

**Mystic:** Channelers of psychic energies, harnessing Mysticism to cast potent spells and possess extraordinary mental abilities. They augment path spells with the mastery die.

**Adept:** Versatile scholars and experts in various fields, proficient in Arcanum for creating magic items, unraveling mysteries, tactics, and spellcraft.

Skullduggery

**Rogue:** Independent-minded individuals with sharp thieving skills, cunning, and a talent for deception. They excel in urban environments, criminal networks, and stealthy problem-solving.

**Assassin:** Masters of assassination, skilled in silent kills, deception, ambush, and shadowy operations.

Theurgy

**Theurgist:** Warrior ecclesiastics driven by faith, invoking supernatural spiritual sources through Theurgy. They specialize in Druidry or Hieraticism, channeling divine power to perform miraculous feats.

**Dark Invoker (typically NPC):** necromancers whose mastery over death allows them to command undead, inflict debilitating conditions, and manipulate the energies of decay. They embody the terrifying potential of theurgy when used for malevolent ends.

Adept

Adepts are the experts, alchemists, artificers, bards, loremasters, and scholars of the world. Adventurous merchants and explorers are also counted among their ranks. Whether they are polymaths with a wealth of knowledge keen to unravel mysteries, tacticians who can turn the tide of a battle, or savants researching and creating new spells and magic items, they are highly sought after for their expertise. 

While their primary brand of magic is Arcanum — including crafting, artifice, wards, glyphs, hexes, and alchemy — they are also capable of casting Wizardry spells.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6 → Adroitness d4 → Cleverness (+1) + Expertise d6 → Wizardry (+1) + Perception d4 → Perspicacity (+1). 

**Advantages:** Arcanum, Gift of Magic, Literacy, Scholar. 

**Feats:** Guile, Lore, Ritual Magic, Quick-witted.Assassin

Assassins are skilled killers who often work as lone mercenaries or bounty hunters, taking contracts for murder throughout the realms. They excel in deception and ambush, making use of their mastery of poisons and their ability to strike from the shadows.

These deadly professionals are known for their agility, quick thinking, and proficiency with ranged weapons like the bow or crossbow. In addition, they are experts in the use of concealable weaponry, stealth, and hand-to-hand combat. A sharp perception and the ability to stay hidden and undetected are essential traits for any successful assassin.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d4 → Adroitness d6 + Perception d4. Prowess d4 → Agility d4 + Vitality d6 + Melee d4 (focus of either Finesse +1 or Ranged Finesse +1).

**Advantages:** Expeditious, Heightened Senses (hearing), Observant, Read Emotions.

**Feats:** Death Strike, Lethal Exploit, Ranged Ambush, Shadow WalkBarbarian

Barbarians are savage fighters, known for their brutal battle tactics and berserker rage. While they may hail from less civilized lands, those who become adventurers have adapted to a more complex life. 

They are not mere savages, plunderers, or bandits. With honed combat skills and a fierce determination, barbarians are capable of taking down even the most formidable of foes.

**Base die ranks:** Prowess d6 → Melee d8. Fortitude d4 → Strength d4 → Ferocity (+1). 

**Advantages:** Animal Affinity, Brutishness, Menacing, Resilient. 

**Feats:** Berserk, Brawl, Feat of Strength, Grapple.

Mage

Mages study ancient grimoires and occult knowledge to cast reality-altering spells, specializing in one of three paths: Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or Sorcery, which determine the spells they can augment with level mastery. 

Wizardry is a key focus for mages, representing a tremendous amount of knowledge and training in manipulating magic, extending to proficiency in artificing, curses, potions, wards, and necessary material components. 

Mages also possess important feats in Arcane Finesse and Dweomercraft, allowing them to fine-tune spells and amplify their effects, respectively.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6 → Expertise d8 → Wizardry (+1). Fortitude d4 → Willpower d6 → Resistance (+1). 

**Advantages:** Arcanum, Gift of Magic, Magic Defense, Scholar. 

**Feats:** Arcane Finesse, Dweomers, Intangible Threat, Path Mastery (Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or Sorcery).

Mystic

Mystics possess a powerful connection to the magical energies of the world, specializing in the path of Mysticism, which allows them to cast spells of incredible potency. They are encountered as mysterious travelers, warriors, or contemplatives with extraordinary powers of the mind. Unlike Mages and Theurgists, who often diversify their magical studies, Mystics concentrate on spiritual knowledge and power through mysticism and psychogenics. 

Although their primary expertise lies in their own mystical practices, Mystics have the ability to learn spells from other wizardry paths. However, when casting spells outside their class, they experience the same spell failure mechanics as other practitioners.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d6 → Expertise d6 + Wizardry (+1). Prowess d4 → Melee d4 Fortitude d4→ Endurance d6 → Resilience (+1) & Vitality (+2). 

**Advantages:** Empathic, Gift of Magic, Intuitive, Magic Resistance (Lesser), Strong-Willed. 

**Feats:** Iron Mind, Path Mastery (Mysticism), Premonition, Psychic Powers.Rogue

Rogues are independent-minded individuals who thrive on the outskirts of society. They possess sharp thieving skills, cunning, and a talent for deception, making them highly valued in criminal organizations and situations that require stealth and subterfuge.

Resourcefulness and good fortune are traits that come naturally to rogues, allowing them to easily navigate obstacles and seize opportunities that others might miss. Their expertise in urban environments and criminal networks makes them highly effective in such settings.

In addition, rogues possess unique abilities, such as dealing extra damage, evading danger, manipulating others, and moving discreetly and unnoticed.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d4 → Adroitness d4 → Skulduggery (+1) + Perception d4. Prowess d6 → Agility d8. 

**Advantages:** Expeditious, Fortunate, Streetwise, Underworld Contacts. 

**Feats:** Backstab, Evasion, Roguish Charm, Stealth.

Theurgist

Theurgists are warrior ecclesiastics whose faith fuels their gift of magic, devoted to a pantheon or specific god (or Nature as a divinity). The class's clothing, weapons, and armor vary depending on the prevailing culture and the chosen magic path, either Druidry or Heiraticism. 

Theurgy is a focus skill of the class, allowing theurgists to invoke supernatural spiritual sources to restore, revive, heal, vivify, or otherwise affect living things. They can also use this focus to animate the dead or inflict death, disease, and decay. Theurgy represents the two sides of the coin of restoration and life or destruction and decay, and theurgists must choose which path to follow.

**Base die ranks:** Competence d8 → Expertise d4 → Theurgy (+1). Fortitude d6 → Willpower d4. 

**Advantages:** Gift of Magic, Magic Defense, Religion, Strong-Willed. 

**Feats:** Divine Healing, Path Mastery (Druidry or Heiraticism), Spiritual Smite, Supernatural Intervention.

Warrior

Warriors are of many types. Some are ordinary fighters or fencing masters who excel at swordplay or brawling. Others may be ordinary soldiers and men-at-arms, local deputy marshals or constables, military officers, landless or landed knights, or high-ranking naval or military officers. 

They are among the most powerful defenders of human realms against the supernatural, with greater resistance to magic than other classes.

**Base die ranks:** Prowess d8 → Melee d6 → Threat (+1). Fortitude d6. 

**Advantages:** Commanding, Intimidation, Magic Resistance (+1), Tactician. 

**Feats:** Battle Savvy, Maneuvers, Stunning Reversal, Sunder Foe.

Character Class Feats

Each class lists special feats. A character of a particular class may, at any time, attempt any feat listed for that class. Class feats are executed or activated by rolling a test versus the feat’s challenge die. 

The challenge die varies depending on the power level of the feat chosen. Every feat requires the roll of one of the three main abilities; either Competence, Prowess, or Fortitude, plus any listed specialty die, then adding any class-based modifiers or focus bonus.

For example, if a warrior chooses to use the Focused Strike feat, he will roll his Prowess plus Melee dice, add any bonus based on Focus, and check the result against the challenge die result.

Feats that alter combat by imposing major afflictions or bypassing active defense require expending a mastery die. To activate such feats, players must spend one mastery die to add to the ability test. If no mastery die uses remain, players can spend spirit points equal to their mastery die rank (MV) for one additional use. The feat only expends Spirit Points upon successful activation, not if it fails.

Mastery Die

The number of times a character can use the mastery die per day increases with their level. The mastery die can be used up to twice per day at level 1, up to four times per day at level 2, up to six times per day at level 3, up to eight times per day at level 4, and up to ten times per day at level 5. 

The player always chooses whether to use the mastery die or not, and each use can be applied to any situation or combat encounter, with no limitation on the number of times it can be used within a single encounter or situation, as long as it doesn't exceed the total daily usage.

Duplicate Ability Ranks and Advantages 

Race and class selections provide base die ranks, not cumulative bonuses. Identical ranks or advantages from both selections grant a one-time benefit: an extra 2-point advantage or an upgrade. This doesn't increase ability branches, and any point difference from swapping a duplicate advantage is lost. These ranks are your abilities' starting points, not added bonuses.

Multi-class Characters

At Level 3, a character may choose to purchase a feat from another class, provided they meet all the minimum die-ranks for that class and have a good narrative reason for it. The cost of purchasing a feat from another class is keyed to character level. At 3rd level, it costs 8 character points, 6 CPs at 4th level, and 4 CPs at 5th level. 

Keep in mind that the Gift of Magic is required to even consider purchasing spellcasting-related feats from another class, and it is an early character creation choice. The implementation of multi-classing is a collaborative effort between the player and GM, and a great deal of narrative justification is necessary in the campaign.3. Advantages and Flaws

Advantages are useful character traits. Flaws are hindering traits. Some are innate or background-specific and can be acquired only at character creation. For example, a creature either has Night Vision or not. Rarely, advantages may be obtained or flaws incurred while adventuring.

Advantages

Advantages are traits that help a character in some way (usually those capacities and aptitudes ill-suited to the two-tiered Basic → Specialty skill structure). Each advantage costs character points (usually 1 to 3) to acquire unless granted by the chosen race or class. A few advantages are optionally broken into levels, costing 1 to 4 character points apiece.

**Animal Affinity (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to any Competence → Expertise roll concerning natural fauna lore, or involving practical animal handling, such as riding, training animals, or taming wild beasts.

**Arcane Inheritance (4 CPs):** The Iconic Arcane Inheritance advantage allows 1st-level characters to enhance their chosen iconic item or weapon with inherent magical properties, passed down from an ancestor or discovered during a significant event. This inherent magic is resilient and cannot be dispelled by any known means. The item's magical properties are determined during character creation and can be further augmented as the character progresses.

**Arcanum (4 CPs):** Arcanum is the study of using magical formulae to create magic items, potions, arcane glyphs, and wards. It grants +2 to any Competence → Expertise roll when creating or using such. Arcanum is more craft than art, and in theory, arcanists follow the prescribed rituals, prepare the magical ingredients when the stars are right, chant the ancient phrases, and so on, as if following a recipe. If all is correct, it works, but not everyone can follow a recipe, and when invoking mystic forces, the results of failure can be more than a burned pot.

Only those who have the advantage of the Gift of Magic may purchase Arcanum if it is not already granted by their character class.

**Attractiveness (2 CPs):** Others find the PC beautiful or handsome and thus tend to react well to the PC. This ranked advantage ranges from a d4 to a d12, at 2 CPs per level. The PC can attempt to manipulate NPCs with an opposing die roll vs. Fortitude → Willpower → Courage.

**Brutishness (2 CPs):** Grants +1 per 2 CPs, up to +4, to potential harm in any form of unarmed combat. The bonus also applies to any opposed rolls in unarmed combat.

**Commanding (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to Competence rolls when directing troops or planning alongside allies.

**Eidetic Memory (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to learning a new spell or recalling facts (Competence → Perception vs. challenge die).

**Empathic (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to Competence → Perception rolls when reading somebody’s emotions.

**Expeditious (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to all Prowess → Agility → Speed rolls when running or sprinting.

**Fortunate (4 CPs):** The character tends to be very lucky. Re-roll every result of 1 on any test or threat die (attack) roll (once per day).

**Gift of Magic and Magic Defense (8 or 12 CPs):** Characters with the Gift of Magic advantage gain the ability to cast spells. Tier 1 of the advantage allows the casting of wizard or theurgist spells, while Tier 2 provides access to the Magic Defense benefit. If a character’s race and class both have the Gift of Magic advantage, he or she automatically gains access to Tier 2. 

**Magic Defense** allows magic-wielders to use their Active Defense Pool to create a protective energy that shields them from non-physical magical damage such as psychic attacks. This can make a difference in reducing or blocking harm from magical sources. 

However, Magic Defense (12 CPs) does not protect against magical effects that require a saving throw, such as Affliction effects. In such cases, the caster can use the Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy branch to attempt to mitigate the effect of the Affliction effect spell with an opposed roll. 

**Heightened Senses (2+ CPs):** The character’s senses (sight, vision, taste/smell, touch) are superior to those of the average member of his species. The PC can choose one heightened sense for every 2 CPs. This allows a +1 bonus on ability tests using the heightened sense (most likely Competence → Perception, but other abilities might be affected).

**Inconspicuous Caster (2 CPs):** This advantage requires Gift of Magic as a prerequisite. Spells are usually cast with dramatic words and gestures, making magic use obvious. Sometimes mages may wish to be subtler and avoid one or both, but it is difficult, with a normal penalty of –4 to the test if dropping either words or gestures, and –6 to cast with neither. This advantage halves the penalties to –2/–3. It is most useful if the caster is silenced or restrained somehow, e.g., bound and gagged. If used combined with a basic Harm effect spell attack, a challenge die vs. d4+2 (silent) or d4+3 (silent and still) is required to succeed.

**Intimidation (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to Fortitude ability rolls, invoking the character’s powerful presence to dominate or resist.

**Intuitive (2 CPs):** Grants +2 on Perception branch checks (including for other advantages, such as Read Emotions).

**Linguist (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to Competence rolls when attempting to speak or understand (but not read or write) any common spoken language in the milieu. A PC who wants to learn rare, ancient, or arcane languages can purchase that extra depth of skill at 1 CP for each of the three.

**Literacy (1–2 CPs):** The ability to read written language (1 CPs for literacy in one language and 2 CPs for all languages one knows). Note the PC must be able to speak a language to be literate in it. One may take this advantage once for each language one is literate in, or just spend two points and assume nominal literacy in all languages one knows.

**Lorekeeper (2 CPs):** Your character has a natural talent for acquiring and retaining knowledge. You have a +2 bonus to any Competence → Expertise roll involving researching, recalling, or analyzing information, especially related to history, culture, magic, and legends. In addition, once per session, you may ask the GM for a hint or clue related to the current situation, based on your character's intuition and understanding of the world. The GM will provide a useful piece of information or insight that can aid your party in their endeavors.

**Magic Defense:** see Gift of Magic.

**Magic Resistance (2 or 4 CPs):** Lesser magic resistance (2 CPs) boosts saving throws against magical afflictions that affect the body or mind by +1. Some races have this as a granted advantage, and otherwise a good story for this advantage is encouraged. Magical afflictions are described in GM’s section. The Greater Resistance tier (4 CPs) boosts saves against d10 and d12 magical afflictions by +2. This includes Control Mind, Possess Spirit, Paralyze, and Incapacitate. Each level can only be purchased once, and bonuses do not stack (+1 or +2 to save, not +3).

**Menacing (2 CPs):** Grants +2 on Competence → Perception (where it involves gauging susceptibility to coercion) or Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might rolls.

**Mythic Physiology (GM fiat):** This is a species advantage that grants the character supernatural traits and abilities, reflecting their magical or ancestral heritage. The abilities can include Elemental Affinity, Natural Armor, or Enhanced Senses, and may be inspired by creatures like demons, dragons, or other mythical beings. These traits are typically incorporated into the character's concept or species choice during character creation. For example, a character with Mythic Physiology may be a half-demon or a dragonkin, gaining enhanced Strength, Agility, or Endurance, as well as resistance to magical attacks or the ability to wield magic.

While Mythic Physiology can be advantageous in combat and other situations, it also comes with challenges and drawbacks. Others may fear or discriminate against the character due to their supernatural abilities, and their powers may have unique limitations or side effects (see Unsettling Flaw).

**Mythic Vision:** Magical Vision (2 or 4 CPs or GM fiat): This advantage enhances the character's vision in low-light or complete darkness conditions. Typically, these innate abilities are unavailable for purchase, but those characters desiring such may have them if the GM allows.

Low-light Vision (2 CPs) allows the character to see well in dim lighting conditions, including starlight, without penalties to ability tests in combat and other situations. 

Night Vision (4 CPs) allows the character to see perfectly in the dark without the aid of torches or lanterns, such vision extending out to 60 feet. 

**Natural Talent (2 CPs):** Grants +2 to all Competence → Expertise checks, for instance on Linguistic tests.

**Observant (2 CPs):** Grants +2 on Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.

**Read Emotions (2 CPs):** Grants insight into a target’s motivations and emotional state, especially useful if that is at odds with behavior. Uses Competence as the basic ability. If the character is also intuitive, add +2 to the roll.

**Religion (2 CPs):** Knowledge of the beliefs, customs, and rituals surrounding the organized worship of a deity or pantheon. Includes understanding of holy days, forms of sacrifice or propitiation, and priestly hierarchies.

**Resilient (2 CPs):** (fast Healer) The character heals passive defense points at twice the normal rate. (Such fast healing is 2 hit points per day of rest or 4 hit points per day of total bed rest.)

**Scholar (2 CPs):** Grants +2 on all Competence → Expertise checks for class-based knowledge. This will be legends & lore for adepts and mages, strategy & tactics for warriors, and so on, as decided by the GM.

**Sense of Direction (1 CPs):** This is the innate ability to find one’s way. A character with this advantage can always find true north and know what direction he faces underground or total darkness. One with this advantage can also sense direction in directionless places, such as magical mazes and extra-planar realms.

**Streetwise (2 CPs):** Grants +2 on all Competence → Adroitness rolls for social interaction in challenging urban situations.

**Strong-willed (2 CPs):** +2 on Fortitude → Willpower → Courage rolls.

**Survival (2 CPs):** Allows the character to survive in the wilderness, finding food, water, and shelter. (All adventurers have the basic tier Competence ability in Survival.) Purchase of the advantage grants a bonus of +1 through +5, at 2 CPs per level, to survival checks, including understanding hazards, exploring areas to scout out information, and tracking and observing creatures.

**Tactician (2 CPs):** Allows the character to swap out Prowess for Competence when performing a battle maneuver involving an opposed roll (Prowess → Melee) and add +2 to the ability test. Does not apply to potential harm.

**Underworld Contacts (1 CPs):** The character knows several shady characters in less than reputable lines of work. In new locations, the character will know where to find such persons. The GM controls all such contacts.

Flaws

The opposite of advantages, flaws are traits that hinder a character in some way. When selecting a flaw, a character gains between 1 to 4 character points to use in character creation.

These bonus CPs are available at character creation only. Acquiring a flaw through gameplay does not award any points.

The number of flaws any PC possesses to start with should not exceed 4 CPs in total.

**Addiction (1–3 CPs):** The character is addicted to some substance. The character will spend at least an hour a day using the substance and spend a good portion of income acquiring it. It is possible to get clean from an addiction, but the character will have to make a Courage roll in times of great stress to avoid returning to the substance. Addiction may be acquired as a 1 CP, 2 CPs, or 3 CPs flaw. 

If the character is forced to go for two days without the object of a 1-point addiction, all actions are at –1 penalty and will increase by an additional –1 for every two days that pass without using the substance. A 2-point addiction lowers any test by –2 for every three days without the object of addiction and a 3-point addiction lowers any test by –3 for every four days. 

Note that addictive substances often have other effects on the character’s behavior.

**Clumsy (1 CP):** The character is physically awkward and uncoordinated (1 CP), although training can help. Agility and Vitality die ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10).

**Compulsion (1–3 CPs):** This flaw is much like an addiction but to an activity, not a substance. A compulsive PC will constantly try to perform the stated behavior and will do so at any opportunity.

Examples of a compulsive person are a pyromaniac, a pathological liar, and a problem gambler. The Compulsion flaw causes the same penalties as the Addiction flaw, and it may be acquired as a 1 CP, 2 CPs, or 3 CPs flaw.

**Debility (2 CPs):** Impairment due to mundane and magical allergies and phobias which impair skill use when the allergen or feared thing is present (this should be common, e.g., a primary color, a path of magic, fire, garlic, heights, mirrors, plants, rats, silver, snakes, spiders, sunlight, swords, undead, water). One less die rank on any test or attack.

**Dim-witted (1 CP):** The character is slow on the uptake (1 CP), although training can help. Adroitness and Perception die ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10). Some individuals are just born rather stupid.

**Frail (1 CP):** The character is unrobust and prey to illness, influence, etc. (1 CP), although the adventuring life can help. Vitality and Willpower die ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10).

**Impaired Hearing (1–3 CPs):** A character with this flaw does not hear as well as others. He is at a –1 penalty to any skill in which hearing is required (1 CP). Optional levels are available at the GM’s discretion. For 2 CPs, the character is at –2 for skills involving hearing. At the 3-point level, the character is completely deaf and may not make hearing rolls.

This can affect the cost and availability of skills based on hearing, like specialty in Music (GM’s discretion).

**Impaired Smell and Taste (1 CP):** The character cannot smell or taste anything (1 CP). The character cannot detect anything through these senses but is also unaffected by bad smells, like the stench of a skunk, a stagnant, noisome sewer, the putrid smell of rotting fish, and so on.

**Impaired Vision (1–3 CPs):** This flaw requires the character to use mechanical aid to see clearly (i.e., spectacles or magical goggles of some kind).

Without glasses or the equivalent, the character is at a –1 penalty to any skill that requires sight (1 CP). Optional levels are available at the GM’s discretion. For 2 CPs, the character is at –2 penalty for sight skills when unaided by artificial lenses. At the 3-point level, the character is completely blind and may not make sight rolls. Such a character needs significant powers to compensate for blindness, and would likely have to learn magic, and focus on spell types that enhance the senses.

**Restriction (1 CP):** This is any strong limitation on normal adventuring activities due to physical, mental, or magical characteristics, as arbitrated by the GM. Examples include the use of small weapons only (small beings), the inability to use iron weapons or armor (magical creatures), or edged or ranged weapons (some religions or codes).

**Missing Limbs (2 or 3 CPs):** A character can have one missing limb at most to remain viable. IMO

**Missing Arm (2 CPs):** The character is without the use of an arm. It need not be completely missing but is not usable in any way. Tasks that require the use of two hands are all but impossible. The character cannot wield two weapons at once, including small shields, and he can never master two-handed weapons, which are always wielded at –2.

**Missing Leg (3 CPs):** The character is without a leg He can walk with either an artificial leg or crutch at –1 penalty in battle phase initiative.

**Mundane (1 CP):** The character is just not that good at magic (1 CP), although training can help. Expertise die rank is counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10), and saving throws are at –1.

**Mute (2 CPs):** The character is unable to speak. No spells are possible that require the use of speech, nor skills where speech is important. This is ideal for the player who just had his jaw wired shut due to some freak accident.

**Old (1 or 3 CPs):** The character is experienced but past the prime of life (1 CP). The character has a penalty of –1 to Strength and Vitality and heals at half normal rates: 1 hp per 2 days’ rest, or 1 hp per day bed rest. Optionally, the flaw can be taken twice for an ancient greybeard or wizened crone (3 CPs). If so, an extra penalty of –1 to Agility and Perception applies, and the character heals more slowly: 1 hp per 3 days’ rest, or 2 hp per 3 days bed rest. Magic healing works normally.

**Ugliness (1 CP):** The character has an appearance characteristic that is unappealing in some way. The character has a hunchback, crossed eyes, bowed legs, or is just plain ugly. This will often cause a –1 penalty to social reaction. A character may take this flaw up to three times at 1 CP per level of ugliness

**Unsettling (2 CPs):** Your character's appearance or demeanor is unsettling to others. This could be due to demonic or monstrous features, an unsettling aura, or something else. At level 1 (1 CP), your character causes a -1 penalty to social reaction rolls when meeting new people, except for those who are familiar with your character's appearance. At level 2 (2 CPs), the penalty increases to -2.

Note that some NPCs may react negatively or even violently to your character, depending on the setting and the GM's discretion.

**Weak (1 CP):** The character is puny and lacks muscle (1 CP), although training can help. Melee and Strength die ranks are counted as one less (d4 counts as a d2, d12 counts as a d10).4. Calculate Defense Pools 

A Defense Pool is a quantity of hit points used to mitigate or negate threat points. There are two defense pools, the active defense pool (representing actions like parrying, dodging, or “rolling with the punches”) and the passive defense pool (representing actual physical and mental damage).

Spirit points represent a character’s inner reserves and luck and can be used in many ways, often to pull something out of the bag when needed.

Your character’s defense points and spirit points are calculated based on the total maximum values of the specified abilities and specialties. Remember, the Max-Value of each die is simply the highest roll possible. Thus, the MV of d4 is 4, of d6 is 6, and so on.

**Active defense pool = Prowess MV + Agility MV +** Melee MV.

**Passive defense pool = Fortitude + Endurance + Strength MV.**

**Spirit Points = Competence MV + Willpower MV.**

**Competence MV + Willpower MV.**

5. Refine Character Concept 

The character concept is worked out in cooperation with the GM. Attributes like intellect, charm, and insight are up to the player to determine and communicate; the rules do not quantify them. Nor are there rules to dictate whether the character relies more on brute strength or adroitness and agility in battle. The player has full freedom to interpret these attributes within the scope of his desired character concept.

Gender/Age

Human characters most often begin their adventuring careers during their youth, but players may create a new character of any age. Flaws can simulate old age problems if the player and GM desire, but there are no strict penalties for creating elderly characters. The GM must approve older characters with assumed experience so as not to grant a single player an unfair advantage.

Starting Equipment

Each character starts with the following items:

•A set of ordinary clothes and a purse of 5 gold coins.

•A backpack, plus a large and small sack.

•A week’s rations, waterskin, and tinderbox.

•A small dagger or hunting knife.

•50' rope, iron spikes, and a small hammer.

•Either 6' traveling staff or 10' pole.

•Either hooded lantern and 2 oil flasks or d4+1 torches.

Beyond the common equipment, each character starts with one of these packs by class:

**Adept:** One book of knowledge in the character’s area of expertise other than ritual magic.

**Assassin:** Assassin hood, jacket, cape, robe, or tunic.

**Barbarian:** Garments made of woven wool or linen, trousers, a tunic, overcoat or cloak, or long tunic with a belt.

**Mage:** One spellbook, staff, or some focus item depending on the type of magic practiced.

**Mystic:** Robes or shawl with the front and the back decorated, cloak, or any loose garments allowing freedom of movement. Armor up to leather.

**Rogue:** One set of thieves' tools, light armor (up to leather), and one weapon.

**Theurgist (priest):** one prayer book, holy relic or symbol, a focus item, and one suit of armor up to chain. 

**Theurgist (Druid):** Robes, cloak, staff, and one common weapon.

**Warrior:** One weapon of choice. Also, one suit of armor up to chain, a small to large shield, and a steed. Plate armor may be agreed upon with GM based on character background.

The reason for a short equipment section is that mundane items do not require excruciating detail — the stock-in-trade of adventurers is mostly weapons, magic, and armor. Accordingly, the rules cover these items thoroughly. Normal treasure takes many forms during an adventure, but players usually convert loot into regular currency without fanfare.

Iconic Props

In the game world, personal iconic items such as magical weapons and foci offer various benefits, including attack options, permitting the use of the mastery die, and the potential for _master twist_ effects. Magic foci enable mages, mystics, and theurgists to channel magical currents, enhancing combat prowess or spellcasting abilities with spirit points. Iconic items come in diverse forms, ranging from melee weapons for barbarians to gemstone rings for adepts, and from inspirational objects like symbolic tattoos for assassins to heirloom lockets for theurgists. Other examples include ancestral journals for mages, totem animal fur scarves for barbarians, ancient maps for rogues, and blessed prayer beads for mystics.

These personalized items help define a character's identity, deepening their connection to their chosen iconic item and augmenting their abilities. The GM may approve or deny a character's background or items beyond the iconic item. Players can dress their character as they see fit, but acquiring magic items for starting characters requires GM approval for specific reasons (see Iconic Inheritance, page 173) .

Choosing an Iconic Item

The GM can approve or deny other things based on a character’s proposed background. Clothes can be whatever the player imagines are appropriate for his character. The GM should not grant magic items to starting characters unless having a special reason to do so. 

Players can choose nonmagical iconic items for their characters during creation, while magical iconic items can be purchased with character points or found during an adventure and deemed "iconic" once a new level is gained. 

Iconic item benefits

**Iconic Weapon Bonus:** This bonus grants a static +1 threat point to the attack roll per character level, enhancing the potential harm output. For example, a level 3 character wielding an iconic axe would indeed add +3 to their attack roll’s potential harm. 

**Damage Type Focus Bonus:** Further bonuses are applied if the character possesses a focus aligning with their Iconic Weapon's damage type. For example:

Crushing: Add _Might_ (Strength) focus.

Slashing/Cutting: Add _Ferocity_ (Strength) focus.

Impaling: Add _Speed_ (Agility) focus, or _Skullduggery_ (Adroitness) if a Rogue. 

**Specialist Bonus:** Characters specializing in combat (Melee or Precision) gain an additional bonus to potential harm via their focus. Melee specialists add their Threat focus bonus and Precision specialists add their Ranged Threat focus bonus.

**Stacking Focus Bonuses:** These bonuses stack, meaning characters benefit from both their Iconic Weapon Bonus and Damage Type Focus Bonus, in addition to any Specialist Bonus from combat specialization. For instance, a level 3 warrior with the Ferocity focus using an Iconic axe would gain bonuses from the following:

.

**Iconic Master Twist:** An additional roll of the mastery die is granted, adding its result to the total. For weapons and battle foci, this translates to increased threat points, boosting damage output. For other objects and inspiring foci, it enhances the success rate of ability tests, representing heightened skill or a stroke of luck.

**Inspirational Aid:** Iconic items with emotional or historical value can enhance a character's likelihood of success on any ability test or a designated class feat. 

While these items cannot be used for attack actions or feats, they can be employed for non-damaging spells during battle. Inspirational items infused with spirit points bestow temporary bonuses when used. Here is a list of potential nonmagical and potentially magical iconic items for each class:

Nonmagical Iconic Items:

**Adepts:** Personalized grimoires, ornate crystal orbs, and wands crafted from rare woods.

**Assassins:** Customized throwing knives, stylish cloaks, and poison vial necklaces.

**Barbarians:** Totem animal pelts, necklaces made of bear claws, and intricately designed metal shields.

**Mages:** Unique focus items, elegant rings, and decorative potion bottles.

**Mystics:** Beautiful prayer beads, carved staffs, and holy symbols with detailed engravings.

**Rogues:** Artisanal lockpicks, cloaks with hidden pockets, and lightweight boots.

**Theurgists:** Holy relics with intricate designs, ornate prayer beads, and exquisite potion bottles.

**Warriors:** Weapons with distinctive shapes or engravings, shields with unique symbols, and armor forged with an eye-catching appearance.

The reason for a short equipment section is that mundane items do not require excruciating detail — the stock-in-trade of adventurers is mostly weapons, magic, and armor. Accordingly, the rules cover these items thoroughly. Normal treasure takes many forms during an adventure, but players usually convert loot into regular currency without fanfare.

Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition uses a flexible point-buy system for character creation. The provided class and race options offer a balanced and fun experience without the need to calculate exact point costs. Players are encouraged to prioritize their character's vision and play style over point optimization. However, advanced players can delve into detailed point-cost rules and collaborate with the GM to create unique combinations of class and fantasy races.

Chapter 2: Action System

The Eldritch RPG describes proficiency with the general term ability, with several types and quantities of dice measuring abilities in the game. Type refers to the number of sides on a die. Quantity refers to the number of dice rolled for a single action resolution attempt. Abilities subsume all traits and skills. The three basic abilities for characters in the Eldritch game are Competence, Prowess, and Fortitude. They cover what characters may know, their ability to fight, and how they adapt to the challenges of adventuring and the unexpected. These core capacities form the basis for almost all actions in the game.

Ability Trees and Branches

Most actions use both a basic ability and specialty (that is, any innate physical or mental capacity and learned skill), possibly with a focus. Some abilities directly impact combat statistics; some do not. The importance of each depends on the story and the nature of the campaign. The ability structure can be compared to a tree, with one branch comprising the basic ability (the trunk) and its specialty (the branch). Offshoots are the focus areas of specialization.

The basic, specialty, and focus areas comprise the whole tree with multiple branches. 

The arrangement is reflected in Eldritch character sheets (see Appendix). Full-fledged characters measure the level of their traits and skills by die rank. 

Rank is expressed as the die value itself: d4 (average human; default basic rank), then d6, d8, d10, and d12 (the highest rank for standard characters). Focuses simply add a static bonus from +1 to +5.

Branch Rank

The sum of the maximum values of the basic, specialty, and focus areas of a branch of a character’s ability tree gives his or her branch rank. This is a useful overall indication of proficiency or power in that branch.

Ability Branch Skill Levels

**•Average:** 4+

**•Respectable:** 6+

**•Skilled:** 12+

**•Great:** 18+

**•Phenomenal:** 24+

Ability Descriptions

In Eldritch, skills are divided into three basic abilities, each of which has three specialties. Each specialty has two focus areas. The basic, specialty, and focus areas of a character’s ability tree are described below.

Competence

This basic ability represents acumen and overall potential, affecting shrewdness, reputation, natural luck, and capacity for influencing others.

**Adroitness**. This Competence specialty measures cleverness, quick-thinking, and even intuitive movement (sensing traps). Those who are adroit are good at jury-rigging and coming up with fast solutions in tough situations.

•**Skulduggery**: This Adroitness focus grants a talent for roguish activity, including deception and trickery, providing a bonus to activities such as stealth, deceit, disguise, bluffing, withholding information, secrets. It also provides a bonus to lying and sensing the lies of others.

•**Cleverness**: This Adroitness focus grants a character greater intellectual acuity or innate cunning, indicating a talent for resourcefulness and ingenuity under pressure.

**Expertise**. This Competence specialty is the measure of knowledge, especially what a character has learned relevant to the role and occupation assumed. Expertise assumes adeptness in a single field by default, with proficiency in related knowledge. This is usually most related to the chosen class, but the player character’s concept may round this out. Those with the Gift of Magic advantage may make use of such knowledge without great danger to themselves.

•**Wizardry**: This Expertise focus represents a tremendous amount of knowledge and training, using magic to sense, control, change, or even create the warp and weft of the fabric of reality. This channels mages' innate gifts for manipulating magic. An adept’s focus in Wizardry extends to artificing, curses, potions, wards, and knowledge of necessary material components.

•**Theurgy**: This Expertise focus is concerned with the life force of living and growing things, and invoking a supernatural spiritual source to restore, revive, heal, vivify, or otherwise affect plants, animals, people, or even monsters. Usually, theurgists call upon their gods, and druids call upon nature (or nature deities). But death is also part of the cycle of life, and necromancers use this focus to invoke evil powers and use negative energy to animate the dead or inflict death, disease, and decay.

**Perception**. This Competence specialty covers general acumen and the ability to notice, discern, and react to things normally hidden.

•**Alertness**: This Perception focus provides a bonus to things such as locating suspicious characters in a crowd, or spotting a hidden mechanism for a trap door, detecting hidden persons and things, or observing stealthy creatures. A character with this focus can better see or discover things others miss.

•**Perspicacity**: This Perception focus deals with astuteness. A character with this focus is shrewd: he has ready insight and good judgment in social situations, and notices crucial details while navigating dangerous environs.

Prowess

This basic ability covers all areas of ability in the skills and capacities needed by adventurers to survive.

**Agility**. This Prowess specialty measures more than speed alone. It includes nimbleness, reflexes, quickness of movement and action, hand/eye coordination, and reaction time. It also ranks a character’s celerity in close combat and his central nervous system’s responsiveness, whether intuitive or through training. Uses include jumping, balance, running, tumbling, catching things, and dodging.

•**Speed**: This Agility focus covers the body’s natural ability to move swiftly, a measure of celerity. Speed affects the calculation of movement, especially while running or sprinting.

•**Reaction**: This Agility focus confers a bonus to responsive action, representing great reflexes and rapidity in decision making amid danger. It is a factor in determining battle phase.

**Melee**. This Prowess specialty covers engaging in battle with hand-held weapons and unarmed brawling. It includes the use of thrown weapons like throwing axes, daggers, or spears. It also subsumes the skill of fisticuffs and using improvised weapons.

•**Threat**: This Melee focus hones combat skills and battle readiness. Characters train to take tactical advantage of their foes' vulnerabilities.

•**Finesse**: This Melee focus deals with the art of using lighter, versatile hand-to-hand weapons, favoring grace over strength. Lighter, well-balanced weapons (daggers, rapiers, light missiles) are often swifter and allow for precise motion.

**Precision**. This Prowess specialty deals with the use of weapons that discharge missiles, whether bows, crossbows, or slings.

•**Ranged Threat**: This Precision focus hones the threat posed by ranged combat skills. Characters train to use missile weapons to take down their enemies with deadly precision.

**Ranged Finesse**: This Precision focus improves celerity and quick thinking in using ranged weaponry, gaining the wielder an advantage in battle initiative.

Fortitude

This basic ability encompasses all manner of resisting and mitigating physical and mental harm.

**Endurance**. This Fortitude specialty measures the capability to withstand physical hardship, fatigue, and torment and measure the body’s natural strength and toughness.

•**Vitality**: This Endurance focus is one of life force, tuning in to the spark of instinct and the energy that drives survival.

•**Resilience**: This Endurance focus increases resistance against fatigue and is used in saving throws against various afflictions, both magical and mundane.

**Strength**. This Fortitude specialty includes things like breaking items, lifting weights, performance (bending bars), pushing, or resistance to various hazardous conditions.

•**Ferocity**: This Strength focus imparts the ability to channel aggression into effective action, not wild rage; a controlled anger that sharpens the senses and strengthens one to battle or to destroy obstacles.

•**Might**: This Strength focus imparts raw physical power, the muscular force allowing one to bend bars, throw open portcullis gates, or bust down doors.

**Willpower**. This Fortitude specialty measures one’s self-control, bravery, and mental power.

• **Courage**: This Willpower focus helps one to persevere in the face of fear, pain, or grief, and withstand difficulty or danger. It can be used as a bonus in a saving throw against magical afflictions of fear or in situations when most mere mortals would flee in terror.

•**Resistance**: This Willpower focus represents the capacity to overcome mental and spiritual pressure, exhaustion, and non-physical harm caused by mind-affecting spells or certain magical traps.

Using Abilities

All ability tests are performed in essentially the same way. The player chooses the ability and whatever specialty is applicable, adds together the rolls for each die in the ability branch, and totals the result, sometimes modified by a focus area bonus or a mastery die for class-specific feats. (If the task is not covered by a specialty or focus area, only the basic ability die applies.) The total is then used in various ways depending on the task or situation.

**Contest:** Against an active opponent, e.g., in a contest of skill, the test roll’s total is compared to an opposed roll by the opponent, using an appropriate ability branch. The higher result wins, with the defender winning a tie.

**Situation:** When there is no active opponent, e.g., if a character is trying to climb a wall, the GM decides on a level of challenge and rolls the applicable challenge die corresponding to the difficulty level. If the player’s total is higher, the character succeeds.

**Spells, Powers, and Feats:** When using most spells, innate magical powers, or special combat feats, the total of the test is compared to the result of the challenge die set for the action. If the player’s total is equal or higher, the action takes effect (although its success may depend on a following opposed roll).

**Attacks:** Attacking is resolved differently from other actions in the game. There is no opposed roll. Instead, when attacking an opponent with any weapon or potentially damaging spell, the dice total determines potential harm to the target or targets. These threat points can be reduced or negated by shield, armor, and the target’s active defense pool before causing actual damage.

Attacks are dealt with in the Combat chapter, spells in the Magic chapter, and feats in the Class Feats section. Some examples of contested and situational challenges follow. 

Contest. A character shadowing someone in town might use Prowess → Agility against the Competence → Perception of the person being shadowed. 

For instance Narr the rogue (Prowess d8→ Agility d6) is following Geesler (a merchant and adept, Competence d6 → Perception d6). Narr and Geesler both roll a 7 total, which as it is a draw means that Geesler’s beady eyes spot the tail.

Situation. Edmas the warrior is struggling through the desert towards an oasis. It has been two days since his horse died and he has no water. The GM determines that pushing on is demanding because of the heat, dehydration, and exhaustion, but Edmas is driven by thirst and hope, so the challenge die will only be difficult (a d8). The GM rolls an 8, but Edmas (Fortitude d6 → Vitality d4) rolls a 9, so the character makes it to the oasis and can slake his thirst.

Twisting Branches

A character is a metaphorical forest of knowledge and skill. Certain circumstances, primarily feats, allow for "twisted branches," where a focus or specialty from a different branch is used. Twisted branches are denoted with a "+" instead of "→" to indicate crossover. While some feats may use two focuses, only the higher focus contributes to the test roll.

Improving Abilities

It costs character points equal to the maximum value of the die rank to increase an ability or specialty one step. All basic (1st tier) abilities default to a rank of d4 if the character is untrained: this is the average human ability, and costs nothing. Specialties require training, so it costs 4 CPs to gain a d4 rank in one. 

Increasing an ability or specialty from d4 to d6 costs 6 CPs, and so on for each die rank, up to 12 CPs for d12. Focuses also require training, and grant a static bonus of +1 to +5 to an ability test or potential harm roll, costing 4 CPs for each level. The Cumulative Character Point Costs—Per die rank or Focus Bonus table shows the cost per step increase in die rank for basic abilities and specialties, or the cost for an increase.

Defenses & Spirit Points

Defense pools are separate hit-point pools divided into types of self-protective action or protection, representing most ways the character can evade, mitigate, or endure damage. They are ablative, that is, they are lost in use. Spirit points work similarly, but embody a character’s inner reserves and luck. All derive from abilities.

Active Defense Pool

The active defense pool is calculated as the total maximum values of Prowess + Agility + Melee dice. It is the first line of defense against attack, and measures how many threat points a character can negate by choosing to evade, parry, or dodge. It is rapidly depleted in combat (simulating fatigue) but is just as rapidly refreshed once combat ends. See the Combat chapter for more details.

Passive Defense Pool

The passive defense pool is calculated as the total maximum values of Fortitude + Endurance + Strength MV. 

It is the last mode of defense against attack, and measures how many threat points a character can take in physical damage (including some degree of mental and spiritual Resilience) before dying. It recovers slowly. See the Combat chapter for more details.

Spirit Points

Spirit points are calculated as the total maximum values of Competence + Willpower (a specialization of Fortitude) dice. They can be used to do extraordinary things in the game: quickly recuperate in mid-combat, fight inspiredly, energize spells or magic items, enhance feats, activate certain feat features, or cast spur-of-the-moment spells. If the spirit points spent for an action exceed the number available, the passive defense pool is reduced by the excess. Spirit point use is described in more detail where it applies, e.g., in the Combat and Magic chapters.

Mastery Die

The Mastery Die is a special ability in Eldritch RPG that grants characters an additional die to add to specific rolls, reflecting their growing expertise. The die's size and the number of daily uses increase with the character's level.

For example, at level 1, a character can use a d4 Mastery Die twice per day, while at level 5, they can use a d12 Mastery Die ten times per day. Players have the freedom to use their daily allotment of Mastery Dice strategically, expending them all at once or spreading them out across multiple encounters.

Class Feats

Feats embody exceptional class-based abilities and skills that extend beyond the standard rules. These actions exemplify a character’s talent, strength, willpower, faith, courage, knowledge, or puissance. Every feat has an associated standard test, where players roll dice to match or surpass the challenge die roll result. The higher result prevails, with player characters winning in case of a tie.

Each feat includes the test, the challenge, and a description. Feats can be attempted once per round, individually or in combination, unless stated otherwise. A failed attempt results in no effect.

As part of the general usage rules for the Mastery Die, players can choose to add their character's Mastery Die to the dice rolled for a feat test. Each use of the Mastery Die contributes to the daily limit of uses and is allocated collectively for all Mastery Die applications. The character's mastery die may be added to the dice used twice per day per level.

Simple Feats

Feats are elaborated on in some depth but can be dealt with quickly (in a pick-up game for instance) by ignoring most of those rules, and just adding a mastery die for certain tests or situations (once per encounter per level for adding mastery). Use the feat names as a broad guide, or even simpler, the areas below. 

**Adept:** Social interactions, general knowledge

**Assassin:** Setting ambushes, surprise attacks

**Barbarian:** Unarmed combat, feats of strength.

**Mage:** Path spells (Thaumaturgy or Elementalism or Sorcery), attack spells.

**Mystic:** Path spells (Mysticism), general intuition

**Rogue:** Stealthiness, surprise attacks.

**Theurgist:** Healing, path spells (Hieraticism).

**Warrior:** Melee, ranged combat.

Feat Challenge Types

Feats in Eldritch RPG are special abilities that provide significant advantages in various scenarios.

**Contested** Feats pit the character against a basic creature’s saving throw or an opponent’s ability branch. Since basic opponents are more common, feats first assume the use of creature saving throws. Use the creature’s specific saving throw die if available for basic opponents without detailed stats. For detailed NPCs, refer to the ability branch specified in the feat description. 

**Ranked** Feats involve a test against a fixed or variable Challenge Die. **Situational** Feats are tested against a fixed Challenge Die, with success granting bonuses or penalties. **Threshold** Feats require meeting a prerequisite to bypass defenses. 

Some class feats are grouped under broader categories, indicating a specialization within the class’s skillset. For example, the mage’s Arcane Finesse is not a feat in and of itself but rather a heading for several feats that improve spellcasting.

Feats are further divided into subtypes based on their modality: **Overlay** Feats enhance or modify attacks without requiring extra rolls, allowing for combined effects with a single ability test or attack roll, such as increasing damage or bypassing armor. This means that the same roll determines both the success of the feat and the potential harm or effect. **Full Action** Feats may require a full action but offer myriad benefits. **Reaction** Feats enable strategic defensive or counter-actions, activated in response to specific triggers, and do not consume the character’s action during their battle phase. Each feat belongs to one and only one subtype.

Players can attempt feats once per round. Challenges range in difficulty from D4 (Easy) to D12 (Formidable), with harder challenges resulting in greater consequences, especially for feats outside one’s class. Players can use Inspiration or Panache to avoid these consequences. Generally, a failed feat results in no effect. The Revitalize Action allows characters to regain spirit points and maintain their active defense pool during battles.

**Feat Duration and Maintenance:** To determine if a feat can be prolonged, consider its intent. If it describes a single action or is a gateway to other powers, it’s likely not maintainable. If it generates a new condition or state that can be sustained over time, it’s likely maintainable. 

Maintainable feats have a default duration of 10 seconds (1 round). If a character wants to maintain a feat’s effect past the first round, they must concentrate on prolonging the effect. 

This imposes a penalty on other tests ranging from -1 to -5 (corresponding to the feat’s challenge rank), but not on attack rolls or threat points. Maintaining multiple feats incurs cumulative penalties. For magic-wielders, this stacks with spell maintenance penalties. 

Trying feats from other classes

Characters may attempt feats from other classes if it fits their concept. All feats require an ability branch test with the specified specialization, but the focus area isn't mandatory. When attempting out-of-class feats, the mastery die can be used, but doesn't benefit from the "master twist" mechanic. However, feats requiring mandatory mastery die use (those bypassing active defense, incapacitating, or removing agency) cannot be attempted out-of-class. GMs may rationalize these attempts as imitative or studied, but not mastered, and determine their difficulty. Failed attempts incur a -2 penalty on the character's ability tests in their subsequent turn. See "Combat Options" in Chapter 3 for details.

Class Feat Listings

**•Adept:** Guile, Lore, Ritual Magic, Quick-witted

**•Assassin:** Death Strike, Lethal Exploit, Ranged Ambush, Shadow Walk

**•Barbarian:** Berserk, Brawl, Feat of Strength, Grapple

**•Mage:** Arcane Finesse, Dweomers, Intangible Threat, Path Mastery

**•Mystic:** Iron Mind, Path Mastery, Premonition, Psychic Powers

**•Rogue:** Backstab, Evasion, Roguish Charm, Stealth

**•Theurgist:** Divine Healing, Path Mastery, Spiritual Smite, Supernatural Intervention

**•Warrior:** Battle Savvy, Maneuvers, Stunning Reversal, Sunder Foe

Feats are categorized under broader headings like Arcane Finesse. Each feat requires a dice roll to meet or exceed a challenge die. Players may attempt one feat per round. Challenge difficulty ranges from D4 (Easy) to D12 (Formidable), with harder challenges carrying greater failure consequences.

Many feats allow for "Twisted Branches," combining abilities, specialties, and foci from different branches. 

Some feats require Spirit Points (SP), listed in the description after the feat's modality (full action, overlay, or reaction). SP are only expended upon successful activation, not on failure.

Refer to the following pages for specific subfeat descriptions and their associated challenge levels. 

Feats that bypass active defense points entirely require the use of a mastery die for activation, as well as spirit points. To activate such a feat, a player must expend one of their available daily mastery die uses. Negating a target’s defense in such a way is impossible if no mastery-die slots remain. 

Bypassing shields costs 3-5 spirit points depending on the shield’s rank; bypassing armor costs 1–5 spirit points based on the armor’s die rank; and bypassing active defense points requires 5 spirit points. Keep in mind, you can only use Saving Throws against effects that completely incapacitate or deprive player characters of their agency, such as mind control. **Guile** 

**Test:** Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.

**Challenge (Situational):** d4 to d12 (for +1 to +5 bonus to persuade).

**Description (Full Action):** The adept can influence almost anybody through their exceptional skill in communication. Guile entails astute but sly, cunning, and occasionally dishonest behavior in achieving a goal by persuasion or trickery. 

Adepts' expertise makes them most successful negotiators. The more roguish work within black markets as merchants of uncommon magical items.

**Lore** 

**Test:** Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.

**Challenge (Situational):** GM determines challenge die based on narrative (how the feat would influence the flow of the story).

**Description (Reaction):** Adepts are typically sages who are well-versed in the realm’s locations, people, creatures, and metaphysical laws. 

With a successful test, the adept can recall pertinent information helpful to the current mission or dilemma. They may have acquired such knowledge as part of guild training or from tutors or sages, or they may be self-taught, having had access to a library or similar source of information.

**Ritual Magic**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry

**Challenge (Varies):** See the Arcanum section.

**Description (Full Action):** This feat grants unmatched expertise in arcane rituals, crafting magical items, and alchemy. All magic-wielders can use the mastery die in ability tests for magical artifice and alchemy, but only Adepts can do so without suffering negative effects upon failure. Adepts can also cast unlearned spells without spirit point costs, rolling against the spell's default challenge rank or using predetermined ranks from scrolls or glyphs. 

This feat also grants knowledge of the Permanency Ritual, enabling magical items to be recharged instead of becoming inert after their energy is depleted. With the Permanency Transference ability, Adepts can make an item's effect permanent for a cost, though this can only be done once unless renewed by another ritual. The feat further removes maintenance penalties for non-instantaneous ritual effects and offers a casting roll bonus of +2 for every ten minutes of continuous ritual casting, capped at +5. 

**Quick-witted** 

The adept character possesses intuitive savoir-faire; the ability to do the right thing in a sticky situation or act with polished surety socially. The adept’s naturally acute problem-solving skills and deep perception are usually improved through training as well, granting them a most uncommon sense.

**Improvisation** 

**Test:** Competence → Adroitness → Cleverness.

**Challenge (Situational):** GM determines challenge die based on narrative.

**Description (Full Action):** The ability to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties. Also involves assembling something quickly, especially for temporary use, or jury-rigging some solution from whatever resources are at hand. This feat confers a bonus to an ability commensurate with the challenge.

**Social Acumen** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Perspicacity.

**Challenge (Situational):** GM determines challenge die based on narrative and player’s description of intent.

**Description (Reaction):** The ability to understand and deal with any social situation or choice quickly and accurately, and cultivate relationships with and foster goodwill even among the most nefarious of people. A successful test means that appropriate behavior, cultural conduct, or body language and tone is observed, granting a bonus to a contested influence roll commensurate with the challenge (+1 through +5).

Assassins excel at using preparatory skills (such as Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery) to gain surprise. This advantage enhances their deadly feats, typically resolved via a single Prowess-based ability test.

**Death Strike** 

**Test:** Either Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse _or_ Prowess → Melee → Threat.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d10. **Cost**: 1 Mastery Die.

**Description (Full Action):** The assassin strikes from ambush, delivering a potentially deadly blow if gaining full surprise over the target. On success, roll the Prowess die a second time and add the result to potential harm. This is particularly deadly in conjunction with a iconic weapon + mastery die (up to four dice may be rolled).

**Stunning Affliction (2 Spirit Points)**. If the Death Strike feat is successful, the player can choose to spend 2 spirit points to apply a stunning effect. The victim must roll a saving throw against the total potential harm as the target number. For basic creatures, use their standard saving throw unless the creature description specifies otherwise. For full-fledged NPCs, this is Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality or Resilience. If the saving throw result is less than the total potential harm, the target is stunned and may neither move nor attack for one full round.

**Lethal Exploit** 

Assassins train to find their target’s weak points, whether it be a place left exposed by armor, or a vulnerability in fighting style or social habits, and exploit this through deadly skill with weapons or the assiduous use of poison.

**Bypass Armor**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee → Finesse 

**Challenge (Variable):** Difficulty equals die rank of target’s armor (d4 to d12). **Cost**: 1 Mastery Die.

**Description (Overlay):** The assassin discerns the most vulnerable spot in the target’s defense and strikes with precision. The result of the Prowess → Melee → Finesse roll is used to determine both the potential harm and to test against the challenge die set by the target’s armor. If the result meets or exceeds the challenge, the armor does not reduce the potential harm from the attack. Failure means the armor protects normally. The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

**Poisoning**

**Test:** Prowess + Expertise + Cleverness + Mastery. Failing this means the attempt to poison fails.

**Challenge (Threshold):** The target’s active defense must also be penetrated or bypassed.

**Description (Full Action):** The assassin prepares a poison and applies it to a weapon, trap, or item to be contacted or substance to be ingested. Failing the test means the attempt to poison fails outright. 

The target’s active defense must be penetrated to passive defense with a standard attack if using a poisoned weapon, or bypassed via a contested roll if delivery is by contact or ingestion. A poisoned creature must make a Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality or Resilience save against a fixed die rank from easy d4 to formidable d12 (indicating level of lethality) or suffer the toxin’s full effect.

Poisoning Methods

The assassin may coat one slashing or piercing weapon or missile with poison. 

Applying the poison takes an action, and the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. Assassins have devious methods to deliver contact poison: poisoning doorknobs, cabinet handles, the sword hilts in an armory, the inside of a piece of clothing, or the outside of a worn glove to deliver the poison subtly. 

A gas or powder to be inhaled is generally delivered by some trapped mechanism. Poison in food or drink requires access and planning, and perhaps gaining the victim’s trust.

**Types of Poison:** There are many types of poisons, and some are deadly on contact, others only when ingested or inhaled. Some deliver extra harm, while others allow a save to prevent deadly or incapacitating afflictions. Strengths depend on the dose, but range in potential harm from 1d4 through to 3d20 or even instant death if failing several saves consecutively.

**Baneberry:** The plant has poisonous berries colored white, red, or purplish-black with clusters of small white flowers. A small dose causes stomach cramps, a burning throat, and nausea.

**Batrachotoxin:** With this poison, an amount the size of two grains of table salt will kill you. It is taken from the skins of diminutive frogs; preparers sweat out the poison over a fire before applying it on their darts. Blowpipes with poison darts are silent killing tools.

**Belladonna (Banewort):** Ingestion of large amounts of this plant may cause lethargy, coma, or death.

**Hemlock:** Beaver Poison. Conium maculatum. Fresh juice (sap) can cause poisoning by ingestion or touch. Finding safe ways of delivering such a poison takes some ingenuity.

**Nightshade:** A narcotic that causes hallucinations, fatal in large doses. A small dose causes loss of voice, loss of movement in fingers and hands, and a nasty back bending.

**Ricin:** Extracted from the seeds of the castor oil plant, just a few grains of the powder can kill someone when injected (in solution), swallowed, or inhaled

**Stavesacre:** Also known as Lousewort. A type of larkspur with poisonous leaves that have emetic and cathartic properties that lead to respiratory failure, bloat, and death.

**Ranged Ambush**

Assassins are skilled with killing targets from afar with incredible accuracy, shooting multiple targets with great speed, or performing trick shots to pin or disarm their quarry.

**Vitality Shot**

**Test:** Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse + Mastery.

**Challenge (Contested):** For basic opponents (minor, standard, exceptional) without detailed stats, use a d12 challenge die or the specific saving throw die for defense negation, if available and higher than d12. For full-fledged NPCs with detailed stats, test the roll against the target’s Prowess → Agility ability branch. **Cost**: 5 SP.

**Description (Overlay):** The assassin carefully aims, and discerning the target’s most vulnerable moment, delivers a potentially deadly attack. Use the test roll for both the feat and the potential harm as a single action. Success means the target cannot use active defense points. The threat points are reduced by armor (but not a shield) before depleting passive defense. Failure means only the normal attack potential harm applies. The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

**Ranged Disarm** 

**Test:** Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse.

**Challenge (Contested):** Roll vs. target’s Prowess → Agility.

**Description (Full Action):** Success means the target’s weapon is knocked out of his hands and onto the ground. It typically takes one full action to retrieve and ready a dropped weapon.

**Pin to Wall**

**Test:** Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse + Mastery.

**Challenge (Contested):** Prowess → Agility.

**Description (Overlay; 5 SP):** This feat pins a target to a spot using a piercing arrow or bolt, usually by aiming for clothing or armor near a wall. Targets lose active defense points until they free themselves. For basic creatures, escaping requires an opposed roll using their standard saving throw against the Assassin’s test roll. For full-fledged NPCs, it requires an opposed roll of Prowess → Agility → Reaction. Failing this, the target provokes an attack of opportunity. The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate

**Ranged Rapid-Shot**

**Test:** Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6

**Description (Overlay):** The assassin fires two shots in the blink of an eye with the chance to slay two foes. This feat allows a second, separate attack, targeting a different foe using the same Prowess → Precision → Ranged Finesse roll. If the feat test succeeds, both attacks are resolved. If the feat test fails, only one of the two targets gets hit, and the second attack is an automatic miss.

**Shadow Walk**

**Test:** Prowess → Agility → Reaction.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d12. **Cost**: 1 Mastery Die.

**Description (Full Action):** In a world where magic shades the real, the assassins' close links with the shadow realm of death confer the esoteric power to traverse shadows. This feat lets the assassin step into and merge with any nearby shadow along with all items normally worn and carried, move within the shadow at normal speed, and jump to adjoining shadows up to three feet away. It is otherwise identical to the Shadow Walk spell (page 141).

**Berserk** 

The barbarian becomes furiously violent, attacking with crazed battle lust.

**Rage**

**Test:** Prowess → Ferocity + Might.

**Challenge (Variable):** d4 (+1 threat points) to d12 (+5 threat points). **Cost**: 1 SP per +1.

**Description (Overlay:** The barbarian channels rage to land a deadly blow. If successful, add the bonus threat points to the attack roll. Use the test roll for both the feat and the attack as a single action. Failure means only the normal potential harm applies.

**Thrash** 

**Test:** Prowess → Precision + Ferocity + Mastery.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d8

**Description (Overlay; 5 SP):** This feat bypasses the target’s active defense points. Use a single ability test roll to determine both the feat’s success and the resultant potential harm. Success means the target cannot use active defense points versus the barbarian’s immediate attack. The threat points are reduced by armor (but not a shield) before depleting passive defense. Failure means only the normal potential harm applies.

**Trounce**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee → Ferocity.

**Challenge (Variable):** Difficulty equals die rank of target’s armor (d4 to d12). **Cost**: : 1-5 SP.

**Description (Overlay) :** Success means threat points exceeding the opponent’s active defense bypass armor (target gets no armor roll). Failure means armor protects normally.

**Brawl** 

The barbarian attacks bare-handed, relying on brute force and aggression.

**Crush** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Ferocity.

**Challenge:** (Fixed): d6. **Cost**: SP 1-5 based on Strength die rank.

**Description (Overlay):** The berserker may add to their attack either an extra roll of the die rank of Strength or +2 threat points, as preferred. If opting for the Strength die roll, the SP cost is based on the die rank: 1 SP for d4, 2 SP for d6, 3 SP for d8, 4 SP for d10, and 5 SP for d12. Failure means only the normal potential harm applies.

**Throw** 

**Test:** Prowess + Melee + Might.

**Challenge:** (Fixed): d6

**Description (Overlay:** SP 2): The opponent is grabbed and thrown. Use the test roll to determine both the feat’s success and the potential harm, adding a damage bonus of +2. If the grabbed opponent is thrown at another opponent or used to hit breakable targets (table, door, etc.), damage is split evenly between the target and what was struck. 

**Tackle**

**Test:** Prowess → Agility + Ferocity.

**Challenge (Contested):** Opposed roll vs. target’s standard saving throw (for basic creatures) or Prowess → Agility → Reaction. **Cost** : 2 SP.

**Description(Overlay):** This feat combines a standard attack with an attempt to knock the opponent prone using the whole body. The maneuver costs 2 Spirit Points and inflicts threat points normally from the ability branch roll. An opponent who fails the contested roll is knocked prone and must spend the next round getting up.

**Feat of Strength** 

**Test:** Prowess → Agility + Ferocity.

**Challenge (Fixed)**

**Description (Full Action):** This feat empowers the barbarian to break down a door, bend metal bars, lift a gate, bash open a chest, or break an object, such as a weapon, or lock, with an incredible display of focused energy. The rage-fueled force of a feat of strength can be used to attack foes through obstacles. GM assigns die rank for objects (see Chapter 8), with an extra Opposed roll vs. target’s Prowess → Agility → Reaction if the first roll was successful for an attack through whatever the barbarian broke

**Grapple** 

**Test:** Prowess → Strength → Might.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d10

**Description (Overlay):** The barbarian grabs and immobilizes the opponent with a wrestling hold such as twisting an arm to lock the joint. Until the opponent breaks the hold, they remain helpless. For basic creatures, breaking the hold requires an opposed roll using their standard saving throw against the result of the successful test roll. For full-fledged NPCs, it requires an opposed roll of Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might. You can attempt this once per round. If an attempt to break free fails, the opponent suffers the potential harm of another roll of the attacker’s Prowess die.

**Arcane Finesse**

Arcane Finesse lets a mage, through his or her superior understanding of magic, fine-tune spells so that they can overcome a target’s defenses. The feat alters a spell as it is cast, imparting a sort of ‘spin’ to it, at a static penalty of +1 per level of the finessed spell (+1 to +5).

**Bypass Armor**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry

**Challenge (Ranked):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12. **Cost**: 1-5 SP + Mastery Die.

**Description (Overlay):** This feat lets the linked attack spell bypass armor if its threat points exceed the defender’s active defense. Use the test roll to determine both the feat’s and the linked attack spell’s success. The SP cost is based on the type of armor being bypassed: 1 SP for light armor, 3 SP for medium armor, and 5 SP for heavy armor. If the spell already bypasses armor, this feat is not necessary. Failure means armor protects normally.

**Bypass Active Defense** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry + Mastery

**Challenge (Ranked):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12. **Cost**: 5 SP.

**Description (Overlay):** This feat allows the linked spell to bypass the target’s active defense points. Use the test roll to determine both the feat’s and linked attack spell’s success. Success means the target cannot use active defense points. The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

**Reduce Saving Throw** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry

**Challenge (Variable):** 1 die rank per –1 static penalty to target saving throw: d4 (–1 penalty) to d12 (–5 penalty). **Cost**: 1-5 SP + Mastery. 

**Description (Overlay):** Linked mostly to Affliction spells, this feat reduces the opponent’s saving throw or opposed roll result. Use a single ability test roll to determine both the feat’s success and the resultant potential harm. Success means the target’s saving throw is rolled with a penalty. The SP cost is based on the penalty applied: 1 SP for a –1 penalty, 2 SP for a –2 penalty, up to 5 SP for a –5 penalty.

**Nullify Shield**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry + Mastery.

**Challenge (Variable):** The challenge die starts at d4, increasing by +1 per level of the linked spell (+1 to +5), and +1 per static reduction to the shield bonus. Cost: SP 3-5 based on shield’s reduction)

**Description (Overlay:** This feat allows the linked spell to negate some or all of the target’s shield damage reduction, including any magical bonuses or spells that act like or bolster shields. If the negation reduction exceeds the shield’s protection, negative numbers translate into extra threat points. Use a single test roll to determine both the feat’s success and the linked spell’s potential harm.

**Absorb Arcane Threat**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry

**Challenge (Variable):** Equal to a challenge die determined by the attacker’s threat level (minor d6, standard, d8, Exceptional d10, Legendary d12). 

**Cost:** SP equal to incoming threat points, up to available Spirit Points

**Description (Reaction):** This feat allows the caster to absorb incoming arcane damage, converting it into a temporary increase in active defense points. The caster can spend Spirit Points up to their available amount to absorb and convert threat points. The absorbed points are immediately added to the caster’s active defense points 

**Dweomers**

Dweomers are incantations and gestures that amplify the effect of other spells. They must be readied beforehand, linked to a chosen spell. This means the mage must declare the use of a dweomer before casting the linked spell during their battle phase. Each dweomer has a maintenance penalty of –1. The linked spell has its own maintenance penalty, so if the linked spell isn’t maintained, neither is the dweomer. Dweomers also usually add a static penalty of +1 per level of the augmented spell (+1 to +5).

**Increase Harm**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Ferocity.

**Challenge (Ranked):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12 Maintenance: –1 . Cost: 1-5 SP. 

**Description (Overlay) Maintenance:** -1: Increases the harm effect of the linked spell, bolstering threat points against the target. Use a single test roll to determine both the dweomer and the attack spell’s success. The spirit point cost is based on the potency increase: 1 SP for a +1 increase, 2 SP for a +2 increase, 3 SP for a +3 increase, 4 SP for a +4 increase, and 5 SP for a +5 increase. This can stack with other enhanced harm threat point spells. Failure means only the normal potential harm applies.

**Make Area Effect**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.

**Challenge (Variable):** d12 for a 1st level mage down to d4 for a 5th level mage.  **Cost**: 1 SP per round.

**Description (Overlay, –1 maint.):** The spell’s effect is transformed into an area effect. The radius equals the ability branch maximum of the linked spell’s ability branch. Failure means only the normal potential effect applies. 

**Revivifying Transference**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Cleverness.

**Challenge (Variable):** Versus challenge of the linked spell; d4 through d12. 

**Description (Full Action, -1 maint):** This dweomer lets the mage reduce the difficulty of the linked spell by a maximum of one step down per level. Each use simultaneously replenishes spirit points up to and even exceeding the maximum score. Excess spirit points immediately drop off once the dweomer’s effect ends. Failure means the dweomer does not take effect, so any disadvantage remains.

**Prevent Failure Effects** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry + Mastery.

**Challenge (Variable):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12. 

**Description (Full Action:** Maintenance: -1): This dweomer prevents spell failure effects of the linked spell while the feat is maintained, even for spells of higher level. Failure means that if the spell fails to activate, there is a consequence to failure as per the Spell Failure Table. Note that this dweomer does not affect path spells, as path spells do not have failure effects.

**Intangible Threat** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.

**Challenge (Variable):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12.

**Description (Overlay; 4-17 SP):** This dweomer converts the threat points from the linked attack spell into non-physical damage, bypassing shields, armor, and certain physical defenses like sword parries. However, the spell maintains its visual and auditory effects, enabling the application of dodges and active defense points. Magical protections against preternatural attacks still work. 

Active defense in this case depends on the ability to move out of the way of the spell’s manifested form, as it cannot be parried or blocked physically. An Intangible Threat attack first drains threat points from active defense, then passive defense (Fortitude). _Spirit Point Costs_: Bypassing Armor: d4 = 1 SP, d6 = 6 SP, d8 = 8 SP, d10 = 10 SP, d12 = 12 SP. Bypassing Shields: Add 3 SP for -1 shield (d8), 4 SP for -2 shield (d10), and 5 SP for -3 shield (d12). Note: If the linked spell already includes defense negation, don’t apply the cost twice. _Example Calculation_: For a linked attack spell with a challenge die of d6, the calculation is: Bypassing armor: 6 SP (1 SP x 6). Total Cost: 6 SP.

**Clandestine Casting** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.

**Challenge (Variable):** The challenge die is the same as the linked spell, ranging from d4 to d12.

**Description (Overlay; 4-7 SP):** This feat lets the mage cast a spell with various grades of undetectability. The four options are casting without words (1 SP), casting without gestures (1 SP), casting without audible effects (2 SP), and casting without visible effects (3 SP). Casting without words or gestures is useful if bound, gagged, or attempting surprise. One cannot dodge a spell with no audible and visible effects, but targets can still apply other forms of active defense. If the linked spell already includes an effect that negates the target’s ability to perceive the attack visually, adjust the spirit point cost accordingly to avoid duplication. For instance, casting a linked attack spell with a challenge die of d6 without words and visible effects results in a total cost of 4 SP (1 SP for casting without words and 3 SP for casting without visible effects). Total Cost: 4 SP.

**Wizardry Path Mastery**

A mage can learn any spell but must specialize in one path—Thaumaturgy, Elementalism, or Sorcery. Specializing eliminates the risk of negative effects from spell failure when casting spells within their chosen path. Also, using a mastery die with a chosen path spell allows a re-roll if it lands on a 1, adding the new result to the total. 

**Iron Mind** 

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6. **Cost**: 1 SP per round.

**Description (Full Action):** This feat blocks any power that lets another creature read the mystic’s mind or pry into thoughts (or memories) so long as it is maintained. Those attempting to read the mind of one so shielded know they are being blocked by magic. Iron Mind can only be maintained while the mystic’s spirit points are above zero. 

**Premonition** 

This feat gives the mystic a range of presentiments about and mystical insights into situations and encounters.

**Insight**

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d4

**Description (Full Action):** Once per day per level, the mystic gains some hint about impending danger or the risks associated with current plans or intended actions. The premonition comes in symbolic imagery, or sometimes interpretable visions, at the GM’s discretion. It cannot extend beyond the action, plan, or intention imagined. Premonitions do not show outcomes but give an idea of the level of danger or range of possibilities.

**Sense Threat**

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d4

**Description (Reaction):** Once per day per level, this feat grants the mystic insight into the target creature’s level of threat. The GM may tell the player whether the target creature is a minor, standard, exceptional, or legendary threat.

**Sixth Sense** 

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6

**Description:** Three times per day per level, this feat gives the mystic the ability to sense danger and direction in unfamiliar situations or environments. It grants the mystic a +2 on all rolls in response to perceived danger or avoiding simple or total surprise.

**Super Intuition**

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality.

**Challenge (Fixed):** d8. **Cost**: 1 SP per use + Mastery.

**Description (Reaction:** 2/day per level): Twice per day per level, this feat grants the mystic an intuitive awareness in dangerous or challenging situations. A non-visual form of premonition, like a tingling sensation or general feeling of warning, increases the caster’s Perception base die rank by 3 ranks. If the Perception rank is already d12, increase rolls by +6.

**Psychic Powers**

This feat lets the mystic employ supernormal perceptions.

**Mind Read** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Wizardry.

**Challenge (Contested):** Target uses Fortitude → Willpower + Resistance. **Cost**: 1 SP per use + Mastery.

**Description (Full Action:** 1/day per level): Once per day per level, the mystic can pick up the surface thoughts of a target for a round per level. The mystic also gains insight into the target’s emotional state, which is an effective way to sense deception. The Mastery Die is required when you first latch into a mind—think of it as focusing your mystical channel attempt at discerning thought and emotion, which needs another contested roll (effectively a saving throw).

**Oneiric Conduit**

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Vitality

**Challenge (Fixed):** d8

**Description:** This feat connects the Mystic’s mastery of the Mysticism path with dream magic, known as Oneiromancy. Upon activation, the Mystic can use Oneiric Conduit once per day for each level they possess. When used independently, Oneiric Conduit allows the Mystic to enter a sleeping target’s dreams, providing the ability to communicate, gather information, or subtly influence the target’s subconscious. As an Overlay with Dreamwalk, it enhances the spell by not requiring additional Spirit Points and doubles the effective range. It also allows the Mystic to bypass physical barriers like walls or doors when connecting with a target’s dreams. This feat cannot be used on preternatural or supernatural creatures.

**See Aura** 

**Test:** Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.

**Challenge (Contested):** target uses Fortitude → Willpower.

**Description (Full Action:** 1/day per level): Once per day per level, this feat lets the mystic see the psychic aura of a creature or object. It shows the general state of health of a creature, such as whether it is sick, weary, or wounded. On a roll of 10 or better, the mystic can determine the type of being, e.g. human, dwarf, or elf, from aura alone. For an object it shows magic (energy fields), and on a roll of 20 or better can distinguish the type of magic present.

**Mystic Path Mastery**

The Mystic Path mastery feat ensures that failed spells from the Mysticism specialty path simply fizzle out with no negative effects. Additionally, when using a mastery die with a spell from this path, the mage can re-roll the die if it lands on a 1, adding the new result to the total.**Backstab**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Speed

**Challenge (Threshold):** Must achieve surprise versus the target’s Competence → Perception.

**Description (Overlay):** A backstab is possible whenever a rogue gains surprise, often using the Stealth feat. If the target is surprised, the rogue rolls an additional Prowess die when making the first attack in the round, with the result added as additional threat points to the total potential harm in a single strike. 

This move becomes even more lethal when the rogue wields an iconic weapon, which not only grants a focus bonus to potential harm but also allows for an additional mastery die roll (a master twist) if the initial roll hits its minimum value, further amplifying the rogue’s damage output.

**Evasion**

This feat lets the rogue avoid situational hazards or attacks.

**Elude Hazard** 

**Test:** Prowess → Adroitness + Cleverness (or + Alertness).

**Challenge:** (Situational): GM determines challenge die or dice.

**Description:** This feat lets the rogue dodge out of the way of a hazard, avoiding all potential harm. The GM decides the level of danger and rolls the applicable die. If the player’s total is higher, the character successfully evades the trap or peril. This feat may be used once per hazardous situation at 1st level, up to 5 times per situation (but only once per round) at level 5.

**Dodge**

**Test:** Prowess → Agility → Reaction + Mastery.

**Challenge (Variable):** d12 for a 1st level rogue down to d4 for a 5th level rogue.

**Description (Reaction:** 4 SP); : This feat lets the rogue dodge out of the way of a melee or missile attack, avoiding all potential harm. It cannot be used to evade spells. This feat may be used once per encounter at 1st level, up to 5 times per encounter (but only once per round) at level 5. The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

**Roguish Charm**

**Test:** Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery

**Challenge (d8)**

**Description (Full Action):** Rogues are known to have almost preternatural charm, some no doubt through guild training. This feat lets the rogue befriend someone or persuade them to do something if succeeding in a roll to charm. If the charming would have the target do something undesirable or out of character, the one affected gets a contested roll (effectively a saving throw) of Fortitude → Willpower against the rogue’s test result.

**Stealth** 

**Test:** Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery

**Challenge (Contested):** versus the target’s Competence → Perception.

**Description (Reaction):** This feat grants the rogue greater skill in moving silently or hiding while remaining stationary. The test opposes any observing creature’s Competence → Perception, or their saving throw stat if they are basic creatures. As with all feats, the rogue’s mastery die can be added to this test.

Successfully using this feat provides a +2 bonus on the subsequent Backstab attack roll, reflecting the rogue’s superior preparation and positioning. Using the Stealth feat outside of combat offers strategic benefits like evading detection, gathering intelligence, or setting up an ambush.

**Divine Healing** 

Theurgists call on higher powers to provide healing. The gods grant their priests restoration magic to heal the faithful, while druids channel the divine energies of the natural world. 

Bolstering spells imbue the recipient with life force in some way, eliminating fatigue or providing energy and stamina. An unconscious creature can stand up and resume activity in the same round that magical healing occurs. Restoring spells heal, effectively treating injuries, curing disease, or countering the effects of poison.

The active defense pool replenishes fully after a brief rest; therefore, healing spells used during combat are most useful in extended battles. Restored hit points cannot exceed the target’s maximum score.

**Bolster or Mend** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Vitality

**Challenge:** d4 (active) or d6 (passive). **Cost**: 1 SP.

**Description (Full Action):** Active or passive hit points are replenished by the amount rolled. Failure means the healing magic fails.

**Cure Debility**

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Vitality

**Challenge:** Special. **Cost**: equals die-rank MV.

**Description (Full Action):** Some magical powers can cause a reduction in a victim’s targeted ability die rank. Usually, this is a temporary reduction. 

The theurgist can spend spirit points to restore any temporarily lost die ranks of the recipient’s abilities (at a spirit point cost equal to the die rank MVs). The recipient must be willing to receive the cure. If the reduction was permanent, such as with the most horrendous of afflictions, then failing a divine intervention, the cost is expended in actual character points rather than spirit points.

**Heal** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Vitality / Resilience

**Challenge (Fixed):** d12. **Cost**: 12 SP. 

**Description (Full Action):** The recipient’s active and passive defense points are bolstered and mended by the roll of the tested ability branch. This subfeat adds both focuses to the restored hit points, but only the higher of the two counts toward the actual ability test roll.

Negate Affliction

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Resistance

**Challenge:** Special. 

**Description (Full Action; SP 4-12):** The challenge die is the Strength of the poison, disease, or condition to cure (specified in the trap, ward, hex, or cursed magic item description). Removes the Affliction or poison effect immediately.

Regenerate

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Resilience

**Challenge (Fixed):** d12. **Cost**: 12 SP.

**Description (Full Action. Maint:** -5): This feat regenerates active and passive defense points by a number matching the roll of the tested ability branch. 

In addition, regeneration allows the regrowth of a bodily part after injury, accelerating the normal healing process to a supernatural level. Limbs regrow and return to full functionality in d4 hours. Like Heal, this subfeat adds both focuses to the regeneration, but only the higher of the two counts toward the actual ability test roll.

Rejuvenate or Heal 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Resilience

**Challenge (Fixed):** d8 (restore active) or d10 (heal passive). **Cost**: 8-10 SP. 

**Description (Full Action):** Active or passive hit points are replenished by MV of the tested ability branch. Failure means the healing still occurs, but costs spirit points equal to half the amount healed, rounded up.

Spiritual Revitalization

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Vitality

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6 (random restoration points) or d8 (fixed MV restoration points).

**Description (Full Action; 6-8 SP):** This feat restores spirit points to the recipient either by the amount rolled or by the MV of the ability branch.

**Spiritual Smite** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee or Precision + Theurgy

**Challenge (Variable):** d8 (+3 threat) to d12 (+5 threat). **Cost**: 8-12 SP; +2 SP per additional +1 threat.

**Description (Overlay):** The theurgist calls upon a higher power to channel damaging energy into any physical attack. Visible spiritual energy (in some way characteristic of the source) augments the weapon used, even if it is only a fist. 

The increase to potential harm is +3 to +5, but can be increased with spirit points at the cost of 2 points per +1, up to a maximum of +10 threat points. The theurgist can opt to merely knock a creature unconscious this way, no matter the number of threat points delivered.

**Theurgy Path Mastery**

A theurgist can learn any spell but must specialize in either Druidry or Hieraticism. Path spells that fail simply fizzle out with no adverse effects. Druids treat Nature as a divinity for spellcasting and feats. 

When using a mastery die with a chosen path spell, the theurgist can re-roll the die if it lands on a 1, adding the new result to the total.

**Supernatural Intervention** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise → Theurgy + Mastery

**Challenge (Fixed):** 2d12. **Cost**: Varies. 

**Description (Full Action):** The theurgist prays to a higher power for direct intervention at a time of great need. Such prayers often get what the deity decides is needed rather than what is asked for. (The GM has complete control over this petitionary feat, but should neither let the gods be imposed upon nor unduly punish players for misguided requests.) The feat requires expending a mastery die to activate.

Possible effects include:

**• Avatar (Legendary, 12 SP):** A representation of the deity itself materializes and either intimidates, persuades, or attacks the enemy. This is rare because if one god intervenes so directly, others may notice and feel the balance of power is threatened. Suddenly, the situation explodes into mayhem as avatars arrive and do battle, sometimes destroying vast areas; the event becomes something few mortals can survive.

**• Banishment (Uncommon, 6 SP):** One key creature or NPC is swept out of the scene by divine power, translocated to some other place nearby, or even yanked through dimensions to face the deity’s ire. As with avatar visitations, this can draw attention from other powerful entities, especially if the one banished was part of another deity’s grand scheme.

**• Activate (Esoteric, 8 SP):** The deity grants temporary teleportation powers for either the individual or group, or immunities to certain types of damage or hazards, or the ability to travel quickly and freely through dangerous or difficult terrain, for a number of hours depending on level; 4 hours at 1st level, 6 hours at 2nd level, 8 hours at 3rd level, 10 hours at 2nd level, and 12 hours at 5th level.

**• Favor:** The theurgist and any present allies gain a favor of choice, for the day or for an encounter. Day: The Fortunate advantage (q.v.) is granted for the day. Those already possessing the advantage re-roll failed ability tests on a result of 1 or 2 rather than a 1. Encounter: Every feat and spell automatically succeeds for the entire encounter, but each instance drains 2 spirit points from the one succeeding.

**• Resurrection:** Resurrection is a powerful intervention to request, requires expendature of a Mastery Die, and costs the theurgist 2d12 spirit points even if unsuccessful. It is rarely repeated since failure might be a divine rejection. If the petition were for one who was unfaithful or opposed to the deity called upon, it could result in a cursed reanimation of the body as a zombie or similar undead with unfortunate consequences.

**• Spell-like power (Varies):** the petitioner may be granted temporary use of a power mirroring any spell in the game. The theurgist can immediately comprehend the formula and cast it without a penalty or a challenge roll. For this sub-effect, the SP cost is determined by matching the rarity of the specific spell being replicated. If the spell is Common, it would cost 4 SP; if Uncommon, 6 SP; if Esoteric, 8 SP; and if Legendary, 12 SP.

**• Summoning:** The theurgist is granted the power to visualize and summon a creature (corporeal or incorporeal, sentient or not) applicable to the situation at hand. The creature materializes and does the theurgist’s bidding for an encounter, or even longer if he can maintain the feat by expending 1d12 spirit points per hour (q.v. Summon Monster spell). For summoning maintenance, charge the same SP/hour as the wall‑to‑spell‑rank above (e.g., an Esoteric summon → 8 SP/hour).**Battle Savvy** 

Warriors train to find their target’s weak points and use weapons with lethal skill.

**Bypass Armor** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee +Ferocity + Mastery

**Challenge (Variable):** Difficulty equals die rank of target’s armor (d4 to d12). **Cost**: 1-5 SP.

**Description (Overlay):** The warrior can discern the most vulnerable spot in the target’s defense and strikes with terrifying fierceness. On success, armor does not reduce potential harm from the subsequent attack. Failure means armor protects normally.

**Focused Strike** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Might

**Challenge (Variable):** d4 (+1 threat) to d12 (+5 threat). **Cost**: 1-5 SP.

**Description (Overlay):** In this feat, the warrior winds up to deliver a crushing attack. Roll the test against the selected challenge die, and add the bonus to the attack. Add the bonus of +1 to +5 to threat points to the attack roll (1 SP per increase).

**Maneuvers** 

Warriors are not averse to using tricks to gain an advantage in combat.

**Disarm** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Finesse

**Challenge (Contested):** Opposed roll vs. target’s Prowess → Melee or Agility (defender chooses)

**Description (Full Action):** Success means the target’s weapon is knocked out of his hands and onto the ground. It typically takes one full action to retrieve and ready a dropped weapon. Failure means that the warrior cannot use the feat again on the next round.

**Feint**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Reaction 

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6.

**Description (Reaction):** The warrior appears to attack from one direction but shifts to another at the last second. Success grants +1 threat points and bypasses non-magical shields of up to -2 rating (medium shield).

**Leg Sweep**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Cleverness

**Threat**

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6

**Description (Overlay):** A minimum damage kick that causes the defender to fall prone. Only basic tier, Prowess-based damage is delivered. If the defender fails a roll of Prowess → Agility roll vs. the attack to remain standing, he falls and must spend the next round getting up.

**Multiple Attacks** 

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Reaction

**Challenge:** Special; once per encounter per level, splitting attack dice pools up to five times during an encounter, up to once per battle round.

**Description (Overlay):** Multiple attacks can be performed with any one-handed weapon. The ability branch dice are split into multiple strikes against a single foe or against different targets within reach. 

Each die rolled delivers a separate attack, each with the threat focus harm bonus added (close or ranged). All attacks are resolved in the actor’s turn.

**Trip**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee +Cleverness

**Challenge (Fixed):** d6

**Description (Overlay):** The warrior trips an opponent with a weapon, making him stumble. Does no damage, but the target staggers and has initiative reduced by one battle phase. Failure means that the warrior cannot use the feat again on the next round. 

**Stunning Reversal**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Vitality

**Challenge:** d10. **Cost**: 1 Mastery Die. 

**Description (Full Action):** The warrior can, as a free action, apply a +3 threat points to augment any single attack while simultaneously restoring his active defense points pool by the Max Value of his Prowess → Melee ability branch. 

**Sunder Foe**

**Test:** Prowess → Melee + Might

**Challenge (Fixed):** d8. **Cost**: 3 SP (Mastery optional). 

**Description (Overlay):** Success against the Challenge adds +3 threat points. Expending 1 Mastery Die before the test optionally enhances a successful strike. The enhancement bypasses armor (d8 or lower) and may sunder non-magical shields/weapons (excluding steel/iron/magic; target gets Skillful/basic save to resist sunder). 

**A minimum Mastery Die roll triggers a Master Twist:** reroll the Mastery Die, add result to threat and test total. MD enhancement use is limited (Level/day). If uses are expended, spend SP=MD rank instead of MD for enhancement effects (this SP cost is additional to the base 3 SP). Using only the base 3 SP grants +3 threat on success but no sunder/bypass.

Chapter 3: Combat

Like many fantasy role-playing games, the Eldritch Role-playing System assumes a substantial part of gameplay will focus on heroic battle. This does not preclude the GM from generating adventures that feature great interaction with less violent plots. Rather, these rules focus on combat because it is traditionally the most difficult aspect for GMs to arbitrate with consistent fairness. 

Even so, this combat system is abstract rather than a “simulation,” the emergent story being the focus of play and the mechanics existing only to further action in the story. 

Whenever battle commences, it is up to each defender to describe how he parries, dodges and evades, deflects, or otherwise absorbs the damage of an opponent’s attack. 

A single roll of the dice determines the success of an attack and resultant damage. The defender’s active and passive defense pool reduces this, as do armor and shields.

Critical Rule! Active defense points are fully refreshed after escaping or ending combat. Generally, a minute to catch one’s breath is enough.

Avoiding Harm

There are three ways to mitigate the Potential Harm:active defense points, shield or armor-based damage reduction, and lastly, a character’s passive defense points.

This is simplified to a single hit point score for most GM-controlled opponents, sometimes adding a roll to determine armor effectiveness.

Defense Hit Points

Active defense refers to using the defense hit point pool based on Prowess, which covers parries, blocking, dodging, and evading attacks, or the damage reduction of shields (which are used actively).

Passive defense refers to using the passive pool of hit points, based on Fortitude, representing overall toughness against physical and mental attack, resilience against fatigue, endurance, physical health, and so on, or the damage reduction of armor (which is used passively). 

Damage reduction reduce threat points by either a fixed amount based on shield type (e.g., –1 damage) or by a random roll based on armor type (e.g., -d6 damage). Magic may work either way.

Combat Rounds

The following is a full breakdown of combat: rounds and movement, attacking, defending, and armor. We will begin with combat rounds and battle phases. 

The system divides combat into rounds. Battle phases help keep track of actions within the round. Each combat round has five 2-second battle phases (1 to 5) and lasts about 10 seconds. Creatures typically perform their actions in descending order of Prowess rank, ranging from d12 (fastest) down to d4 (average Prowess). Each battle phase corresponds to when combatants of a particular Prowess rank take their intended actions.

Battle Phases

Creatures with Prowess ranks higher than d12 take their actions before all others. Creatures with a Prowess lower than d4 move last in the round. 

An action could be attacking, casting a spell, activating a magic item, or using a special ability. Actions may be complex but usually take only one battle phase to perform. 

Battle Phase Table

Do not assume action occurs broken into lockstep phases as if creatures were politely taking turns to attack and defend. Rather, envision a chaotic situation of frantic action! 

Once all creatures have taken their actions, a new round begins. The first action is taken by the creature or character with the highest Prowess: the Max Value of basic Prowess, plus any adjustments based on the Agility-based Reaction focus.

Initiative

Prowess determines a creature's base turn order in a combat round, but specific focus bonuses like the static Reaction and Finesse can enhance it. 

Agility does not directly affect battle phase order but increases movement speed, providing a strategic advantage. A high Agility score boosts the active defense pool, increasing the number of attacks a character can potentially dodge, thus extending their survival time. Random Initiative using Prowess, Agility, and Reaction is a general rule for breaking ties in initiative when neither initiative modifiers nor weapon reach or range offer a clear advantage. 

Battle Phase Modifiers

Reaction

The Agility-based Reaction focus modifies initiative, adding its value to the Prowess Score maximum value to help determine the battle phase. 

Finesse

The Finesse or Ranged Finesse focus bonus adds to a combatant’s initiative when specialized in Melee or Precision respectively and using Finesse weapons (see GM's section on Attack Styles). Initiative-related magic spells can also modify initiative. 

Magical Modifiers to Initiative 

Certain magic can change a creature's initiative (see Battle Phase Table). Initiative bonus spells are powerful. A low Prowess (d4) adept usually acts late, but a +1 bonus can push them into the earlier d6 phase (5-6). This shows how magic can shift combat dynamics by improving initiative without changing base ranks in Prowess, Agility, or Melee specialization.

Turn Order in a Battle Phase

There are two considerations when determining who goes first if several opponents are acting in the same battle phase: Attack Precedence and Heroic Action Order. 

Attack Precedence

The weapons table in the GM's section or Weapons Listing of this book provides information on the range or reach of each weapon, which can help players determine their relative effectiveness for initiative purposes. 

Range refers to the distance a missile weapon can travel before losing accuracy or effectiveness, while reach is the distance from within which a melee weapon can be used effectively in close combat.

Generally, weapons with longer range or reach tend to be more effective for initiative than those with shorter range or reach. 

However, the actual effectiveness of a weapon may vary depending on the situation and other factors. While the rules provide guidance on the general order of effectiveness, it should be treated as a rule of thumb rather than a strict ordering.

In combat, a long-range missile weapon such as a bow typically has a higher priority than a short-range weapon like a dagger, providing the wielder with an initiative advantage. Similarly, a melee weapon with long reach, such as a polearm, will usually have higher priority than a dagger, granting it an initiative advantage as well. Thus, in combat, a bow tends to outperform a dagger.

Heroic Action Order 

If the opponents in the same battle phase (1 through 5) have weapons of equal range or reach, then refer to the heroic action order rule to decide the sequence of action. 

Player-adventurers (PAs), legendary NPCs, and legendary creatures act first or nearly simultaneously in the same battle phase. See Intra-Battle Phase Initiative. The GM may consider precedence for certain weapons or fighting styles if it would grant an obvious advantage. Otherwise, a random initiative roll is used (see below). 

• PAs act first when facing inferior foes (minor, standard, and exceptional level) in the same battle phase, assuming equal reach or range.

• Exceptional creatures act second in the same battle phase.

• Standard creatures act third in the same battle phase.

• Minor creatures act fourth in the same battle phase.

Characters are assumed to be heroes and therefore superior. Exceptional creatures act next in the battle phase, then standard creatures, and lastly, the lowly minor creatures (see page 205). 

However, when legendary NPCs and monsters act in the same battle phase as player characters, the initiative for that turn may be determined by using rolling random initiative within the same battle phase, the highest result acting first, modified by focus bonuses or other factors. 

**Game Master Note:** Initiative is simplified for most monsters since they do not have full-fledged ability listings. Their stat blocks (creature descriptions and statistics) determine initiative and movement.

Random Initiative

Legendary NPCs and monsters are elevated in narrative status to the same level as player characters. Sometimes they act in the same battle phase as player characters. In this case, if initiative modifiers are not a clear determiner and reach or range presents an equal opportunity, then each side determines initiative by rolling basic Prowess → Agility + Reaction focus, the side with the highest result acting first.

The player characters always win ties between a PC and non-player characters or legendary monsters (see GM Section to understand such designations for opponents). 

If multiple PCs share the same battle phase, the players may narratively determine the order of actions through teamwork and coordination. If a decision cannot be reached or if the situation demands a random resolution, the character with the highest Agility score acts first. In case of a tie, a Speed or Reaction focus grants precedence. If those are similar, use Agility MV. Ties between two NPCs attacking each other are resolved in descending order of range or weapon reach, or the GM may force a re-roll.

Surprise

To determine surprise, characters roll Prowess → Agility → Reaction against the target's saving throw (for basic creatures) or Competence → Perception → Alertness (for full-fledged NPCs). Success grants simple surprises, in which defenders lose their first round of attacks but retain active defense. Total surprise requires two successful rolls, causing defenders to lose all actions and active defense in the first round. GMs may opt for group checks based on the most relevant ability. Advanced scouts, sentries, precognition, or magic can counter surprise attempts.

Any character can attempt to use stealth to gain surprise. To do so, roll Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery against the target's standard saving throw (for basic creatures) or Perception (for full-fledged NPCs). Success grants a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. While Rogues excel at this due to their class, it is not exclusive to them. For group ambushes, one character first succeeds on a stealth check, followed by a group check that may include the stealth bonus.

Surprise attacks like Backstab or Death Strike generally target the saving throw of basic creatures or the perception of full-fledged NPCs. These attacks can greatly increase damage and effects, particularly when iconic weapons are involved. In such cases, complete surprise eliminates the need for additional mastery expenditures to bypass defenses.

Movement

Movement in the Eldritch RPG is usually abstract. Players describe such movement as necessary, while the GM tracks how it will affect actions and timing. Occasionally, judging initiative and distance becomes important for tactical or dramatic situations. In that case, maximum movement is determined by character or creature Prowess. The following determines how far a character or other humanoid may move in a round and how it affects attacks.

•**Movement** = 12 + Prowess MV in yards per round (attack without penalty)

•**Running** — Movement ×2 (attack with a penalty, –3)

•**Sprinting** — Movement ×4 (no attack possible at the end of the movement)

This is a base move of 16 yards per round at d4 rank, up to 24 yards per round at d12. Then add +1 yard per die rank of the Agility specialty.

Movement rates of 16/ 20/ 24 yards per round correspond to walking at 3/ 4/ 5 miles per hour, which are normal/ fit/ heroic levels of motion for people — although animals and monsters often move much faster! 

For example, Swift the rogue has Prowess d10, Agility d8. He can walk briskly and engage without penalty at 12+10+3 = 25 yards per round (10 seconds) or 5 yards per battle phase (2 seconds). Swift could cover 50 yards per round running or 100 sprinting (10 or 20 yards per battle phase).

The Attack Action

A standard attempt to inflict damage in Eldritch requires no “to-hit” roll, unlike some role-playing game systems. Instead, once the attacker chooses the attack method, he rolls the dice to determine threat points, representing potential harm. This will be effective and damaging unless the defender can avoid or reduce the threat by some means.

A shield reduces harm by a set amount if the defender has one and has active defense points.

The defender can then choose to use an active defense to avoid the threat. He might describe this action as parrying with a weapon, sidestepping the attack, or jumping out of the way. This reduces potential harm by the calculated number of active defense points.

If the threat points from the attack exceed any active defense and shield, any armor worn can reduce the threat. 

If the threat points have not been completely negated at this point, the remainder deplete passive defense points. If the defender’s passive defense hit points score falls to zero or below, he becomes unconscious. If the score falls to the negative Fortitude MV, he might die (see Healing and Dying section).

Attacking

**Step one**: Attacker rolls to determine potential harm. Normally, only one attack per creature is permitted (but see Special feats later). The total threat points are determined by adding the result of attack rolls. 

Specific focuses also grant bonuses to threat points (Threat focus) or initiative (Finesse focus) when the character specializes in the Melee or Precision attack abilities. A focus in Wizardry or Theurgy can also grant bonuses to threat points.

**Weapon Attack:** Prowess → Melee + Threat focus.

**Ranged Weapon Attack:** Prowess → Precision + Ranged Threat focus.

**Unarmed or Natural Attack:** Prowess → Melee + Threat focus.

**Magic Spell Attack:** Competence → Expertise + Wizardry focus or Theurgy focus.

**Iconic Weapon Bonus:** If using an Iconic Weapon, the player adds an additional bonus of +1 per character level.

**Damage Type Focus Bonus:** If the character possesses a focus matching the weapon's damage type (Might for Crushing, Ferocity for Slashing, or Speed for Impaling), they add that bonus as well.

**Step two**: Defenders with shields reduce threat points by 1–3 (depending on shield size) before using Active Defense points. Shields contribute to a character’s overall defensive potential. Regardless of how the player describes their defensive actions—whether parrying, dodging, or countering—the shield’s mitigation is inherently part of the defense as long as it is held. This reduction represents the shield’s contribution to the character’s deliberate defense, working in concert with dodging, parrying, or countering maneuvers. 

Active Defense points must remain above zero for the shield’s reduction to apply, as it reflects a conscious effort to utilize the shield effectively. Any remaining threat after shield reduction depletes the defender’s Active Defense pool. If the pool is exhausted, proceed to the next step.

**Step three**: (if applicable): Defenders wearing armor subtract a random die roll from the remaining threat points, with the rank of the die dependent on armor type (d4 hide, d6 leather, d8 chain, d10 plate, d12 mithral armor.) Any remaining harm depletes passive defense, causing actual bodily damage.

_Example_: A level 1 warrior, equipped with a short sword, attacks a human opponent armed with a sword and shield, wearing chainmail, and possessing 12 hit points (6 active/6 passive). The warrior’s Prowess (Melee) and weapon specialty grant 2d4+1 for their attack, yielding a potential threat range of 3–9 points. The warrior rolls a 7 on their threat dice.

The defender’s small shield automatically reduces the threat by 1 point, lowering it to 6. The defender then uses their Active Defense pool of 6 points to negate the remaining threat, emerging unscathed. 

 

Attack Types

Untrained Attacks

Most humanoid creatures have and every player character have a d4 rank in Prowess. This represents the basic ability to brawl, swing a weapon, or shoot something rather than a martial discipline. Anybody can pick up an object and swing or throw it, whether a tree branch or a heavy sword. 

Also, heroes in a fantasy world ought to be familiar enough with conventional missile weapons to pick up the average short bow or crossbow and fire it. 

Characters using only basic Prowess roll a d4 for untrained attacks with no specific weapon bonuses added. A higher rank in basic Prowess represents either increasing general knowledge of martial techniques, excellent eyesight, aim, or just natural talent, the interpretation depending on the character concept or monster description.

Melee Attacks

A Melee specialty under Prowess grants expertise with several different forms of attack (hand-to-hand combat or unarmed brawling). 

The properties of each weapon show whether the focus areas of Threat (potential harm increase) or Finesse (bonus to initiative) apply when the character is specialized in Melee and when that specific weapon is wielded. 

Focus areas in Threat or Finesse allow adding +1 up to +5 either to potential harm or to initiative respectively.

Magic Attacks

Woe to any creature assailed by one gifted with knowledge of the arcane! Luckily, not all beings are capable of wielding magic to attack their enemies. 

The universal spell Eldritch Bolt serves as the basic magic attack, requiring no ability test. 

A basic magical attack targets a single creature within line of sight. The mage rolls Competence → Expertise (+ Wizardry or Theurgy) to determine threat points.

Such spells manifest physically and visibly, by touch or at the stated range, and can be dodged by using active defense. However, not all spells are easily blocked, parried, or dodged. Some may bypass active defense points or even armor protection (see the Harm listing in the part of the GM’s section).

Ranged Attacks

A specialty in Precision grants greater skill with any type of ranged weapon requiring martial skill. 

A focus in Ranged Finesse represents honed skill and aim, natural talent, or all of them, and usually increases the initiative bonus or occasionally threat points (e.g., the Great Bow).

Unarmed or Natural Attacks

Beasts and dangerous animals use natural weapons such as teeth and claws, and such attacks are listed as “Natural” threat rank category in creature stat blocks. 

In addition, some creatures use unusual, ranged attacks, like the projectile quills of a manticore, the acidic spit of a giant frog, or a giant who routinely rips trees out of the earth and hurls them at human pests. Creature stat blocks subsume all ranged attacks under a “Ranged” threat rank category. 

When an armed foe parries an unarmed attacker, the attacker suffers potential damage equal to a roll of the defending target's Melee basic rank. If armor does not reduce threat points, this damage deducts directly from passive defense points (shield is disallowed).

Unarmed mystic attacks, as well as natural attacks by beasts and dangerous animals, are treated as normal Melee, with no penalty for facing armed attackers.

Battle Conditions

Distance and Cover Penalties

Distance and cover penalties to Ranged attacks are often unnecessary. The rules deal with range abstractly; if the attacker can see his target, just roll the dice. Remember, in the Eldritch RPG, the attack and damage roll are expressed together as threat points. However, if the GM still wishes to consider distance penalties, some general guidelines apply:

Range

Close range to short-range carries no penalties to a ranged attack. A shot at medium range imposes a penalty of –1 damage per die rolled, while a shot at long range imposes a penalty of —2 damage per die rolled. See below for common missile weapon range increments.

_Missile Weapon Ranges_ 

Weapon — (short / medium / long range in feet) —Damage Type

Compound Bow—Ranged 50’/100’/300’—Impaling

Crossbow, Heavy—Ranged 55’/115’/200’—Impaling

Crossbow, Light—Ranged 75’/150’/300’—Impaling

Dagger (thrown)—Ranged 10’/30’/50’—Impaling

Longbow—Ranged 30’/75’/150’—Impaling

Shortbow—Ranged 20’/50’/100’—Impaling

Sling—Ranged 10’/20’/50’—Crushing

Spear—Ranged 10’/30’/50’—Impaling

Throwing Axe Ranged— 10’/30’/50’—Slashing

_Partial to full cover_

Each level of cover subtracts from the attack’s damage. It is possible to hit a target behind total cover, assuming the weapon used could penetrate the cover. For example, a longbow arrow can easily penetrate a cheap wooden table.

Note: Lying prone would provide the equivalent of moderate cover but would disallow the use of any active defense points. 

Minimal Cover (¼) — subtracts 1 point. 

Moderate Cover (½) — subtracts 2 points. 

Good Cover (¾) — subtracts 3 points. 

Total Cover —GM’s call. If the target is behind a parapet or oak tree, they’re safe, except for area effect spells. If they’re behind a curtain like Polonius in Hamlet, they could be stabbed in the arras!

Iconic Attacks

Every character may possess a iconic weapon or a spellcasting focus called an iconic item, granting greater variety and color to their attacks. An iconic item, whether it is a weapon or a focus (such as a holy symbol or an attuned wand), grants more options in fighting styles and allows greater variation in ability combinations when making attacks.

In addition, making an iconic attack with mastery (as limited by level) triggers the possibility of a master twist effect.

**Master Twist with Iconic Attack:** If the character opts to use the mastery die with an iconic attack and the die rolls its minimum value, the die can be immediately re-rolled, and the new result added to the total. This twist of fate turns a potentially poor roll into a chance for greater success. See the Game Master's section for more details on master twist effects. Iconic items such as spellcasting foci may have other special abilities or augmentations that enhance the character's spellcasting abilities. 

Defense Pool Scores

Defense point pools are hit points divided into self-protective actions or harm mitigation in all the ways the character can endure damage. They are organized into the active and passive defense pools, each a pool of ablative hit points, as described below.

Active Defense 

The active defense hit point pool is the first mode of defense against attack (threat points). The active defense pool is the total max value of the Prowess + Agility + Melee dice added up. It typically involves parrying with a weapon or dodging.

Active defense points are fully refreshed after escaping or ending combat. Generally, a minute to catch one’s breath is enough. The full point total of active defense points is usable by the character regardless of the weapon wielded. A character may switch between weapons at will. For game purposes, the mechanic is the same, but it makes a narrative difference.

Certain weapons may be limited in their capacity to deflect attacks from larger weapons or to dodge them. For example, even a parrying dagger cannot be used to parry or dodge weapons larger or heavier than a medium sword, and a utility knife cannot defend against any axe. The common-sense arbitration of such situations is left to the GM.

Once active defense points hit points reach zero, the character is too exhausted to defend himself with his weapons or to dodge and must find other means of protecting himself until withdrawal and revitalization is possible (see below).

Augment, Drain, or Revitalize

The active defense pool primarily represents dodging and parrying the attacks of opponents but is also an overall measure of fatigue. The active defense score can thus be temporarily augmented or reduced by other factors. 

_Augment or Drain_

Spell powers or magic items with buffing effects can increase the score, either by increasing a linked ability die rank (Prowess, Agility specialty, or Melee specialty) or through spells that increase the active defense hit point score directly. Likewise, the active defense score can be drained by spells that specifically reduce the active defense score, while other spells target spirit points first (psychic damage), if they do not bypass active defense altogether.

_Revitalize (Second Wind)_

If a combatant is not in close combat, they can choose Revitalize, forgoing their action for one round to recover Active Defense points. If engaged in close combat, they must first use a full action to perform a Tactical Withdrawal, moving at least 5 feet away from their opponent while facing them. After creating distance, they can Revitalize on their next turn.Dangerous Environs (Optional)

**Dangerous environments (dungeon corridor, haunted house, muddy swamp) may slow recovery time immediately after combat, up to 10 minutes. The** GM decides.

Passive Defense 

The passive defense pool comprises the physical body, including the ability to withstand fatigue, and some degree of spiritual resilience. It is the last layer of defense against damage (threat points) when all else fails. 

The passive defense pool is the total max value of Fortitude + Endurance + Strength dice. 

This defense pool recovers slowly, 1 hit point per day of rest or 2 hit points per day of total bed rest unless aided by magic or healing ability.

Spirit Points

Spirit points can be used to gain an inspired advantage in combat or other dire circumstances, to augment a feat or powerful magic spell (when indicated in the description), or to invoke the powers of magic items and spell effects using intuition and will.

Spirit points are the total of a character’s Competence + Willpower max value.

Spirit points are fully refreshed once the individual is safe from the threat of physical, psychic, or magical harm.

Spirit Points - Actions

**Invoke:** With this action, the character invokes the magic of a magic item or activates the spell effect written in scrolls, grimoires, or by reading runes or glyphs on walls or other surfaces. Cost is a number of spirit points equal to the rarity or power rank of the magic item or magic effect (see page 168).

**Inspiration:** The character gathers his inner strength to add an inspirational bonus to an ability, feat, spell, or attack roll. It costs 4 spirit points for every +1 bonus to an attack roll or ability test. 

**Panache:** Characters can unleash a burst of inspiration to activate a feat without needing an ability test. This action represents a surge of energy channeled in a moment of quick thinking and daring, often amid danger. The cost equals the maximum value of the relevant Challenge Die rank.

**Surge:** This action allows characters to spend spirit points for an additional use of their mastery die after exhausting daily uses. Surge symbolizes a character tapping into deep reserves of energy and focus to push beyond limits. To use Surge, characters spend spirit points equal to the mastery die rank (d4 at level 1, d6 at level 2, d8 at level 3, d10 at level 4, or d12 at level 5) and roll the mastery die, adding the result to their ability, feat, spell test, or attack roll. Characters must exhaust their regular mastery die rolls before using Surge. The spirit point cost cannot exceed the character's mastery die Maximum Value (MV), which is tied to their level.

**Quickening:** The character spends spirit points equal to the maximum challenge die value to cast a spell quickly, bypassing the ability test. Necessary challenge checks for enhancements still apply. This can be used once per round.

Combat Options

Dual Wielding

Any character may choose to fight with a weapon in each hand, provided the off-hand weapon is smaller and lighter. Basic dual wielding lets one quickly switch between weapons to vary tactics. Use the primary weapon to determine the ability branch and add the bonuses for both weapons when modifying damage. A Melee focus in Finesse allows a coordinated attack. In this case, roll one attack roll for each weapon wielded, but the second weapon only gets a roll of the base ability die rank. 

Also, only a 4th level or higher barbarian or warrior may wield two weapons of the same size. Dual-wielding always incurs a one battle phase penalty. If the character’s initiative is already 1–4, apply a –1 penalty to the Agility specialty initiative modifier.

Opportune Attack

An attack of opportunity allows a PC or NPC an extra, single attack with the full ability branch against a target with which he is engaged. This is a free attack action at close range with a hand-to-hand weapon or an unarmed attack. Use this option in three circumstances: 

• The target turns his back in close combat and runs away without performing a tactical withdrawal. No target defense points are possible in this case.

• The target uses a ranged attack at point-blank range against an armed foe (unless the target is a master of the ranged weapon being used).

• The target casts a magic spell when engaged in close combat. The spell is not disrupted unless the magic-wielder takes damage directly to the passive defense pool.

Tactical Withdrawal

A tactical withdrawal means retreating as a full action in a round (at least 5 feet) while still facing the foe to avoid or fend off any attack. Performing a tactical withdrawal is prerequisite to using the revitalize action. This maneuver is useful for repositioning oneself, making ranged attacks, or avoiding being flanked.

Revitalize Action

**Invigorate:** If out of close combat, a combatant can choose to forgo action for a round to rest and revitalize. Doing so allows for a roll of Prowess + Vitality (focus bonus). The result is added back to the character's Active Defense hit points. If the character is engaged in close combat, they must first perform a tactical withdrawal.

**Deep Recovery:** A combatant may forgo action for a round and spend 1 spirit point to regain Prowess (MV) + Vitality (focus bonus) in active defense hit points.

**Steady Renewal:** If a character continues to Revitalize into a second round, they can choose Steady Renewal. They regain 25% of their active defense pool hit points, plus an additional 10% for each spirit point spent, up to the character’s maximum active defense. Steady Renewal requires a full action to perform. 

Order of Defenses

**1. Shields:** Shields inherently mitigate threat points as part of a character’s overall defensive effort, reducing damage before any Active Defense points are depleted. This reduction reflects the shield’s integration into the defender’s deliberate actions, such as parrying, dodging, or countering. The shield’s damage reduction applies only if the defender’s Active Defense points are above zero, and the reduction depends on the shield type held.

	**2. Active Defense:** After shield mitigation, any remaining threat points are deducted from the target’s Active Defense pool. If the Active Defense pool is sufficient to absorb all remaining threat points, the defense holds, and no further steps are necessary.

**3. Armor:** If threat points penetrate the Active Defense pool, armor provides an additional layer of protection. Roll for damage reduction based on the armor type worn: d4 for hide, d6 for leather, d8 for chainmail, and d10 for plate armor.

**4. Passive defense:** Passive defense is a measure of how much physical punishment a character can take before dropping unconscious or dying.

Defense Negation

In normal combat, attacks and spells deplete Active Defense before affecting armor and passive defense. However, some feats and powerful spells can bypass these defenses, allowing them to disregard armor, drain Spirit Points, or directly impact passive defense. Defense negation can involve bypassing the Active Defense ablative score, negating armor, or rendering shields ineffective.

**Bypassing Active Defense:** Feats, spells, and creature powers can bypass the Active Defense ablative score by requiring a successful d12 challenge die roll and the expenditure of 5 Spirit Points. This reflects the precision and focus needed to overcome such defenses. The Active Defense score represents a character’s ability to dodge, parry, or otherwise avoid harm in combat. By bypassing Active Defense, the spell or ability ignores the target’s evasive maneuvers, making them more susceptible to damage.

**Affliction Effects:** These magical effects bypass the Active Defense score and require a saving throw to resist. Powerful afflictions, such as mind control or incapacitation, can strip all agency from the target and necessitate the expenditure of a mastery die.

**Defense-Negating Harm Spells or Attacks:** Harm spells or attacks that include defense negation can bypass various forms of defense, directly affecting the target’s passive defense. These spells or abilities might bypass one or more of the following defenses, depending on their design:

**• Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1-5 Spirit Points):** The spell or ability can negate the target’s armor up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die for this effect is equal to the armor’s die rank. For example, bypassing plate mail (d10) requires a successful d10 roll and 10 Spirit Points.

**• Bypass Shielding (d8 to d12; 3-5 Spirit Points):** The spell negates the opponent’s held or magical shield up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die is d8 for a -1 shield, requiring 3 Spirit Points; d10 for a -2 shield, requiring 4 Spirit Points; and d12 for a -3 shield, requiring 5 Spirit Points. When combined with a Harm effect, the spell can bypass the target’s shield up to -3 reduction.

**• Bypassing Active Defense:** As described, bypassing the Active Defense ablative score requires a successful d12 challenge die roll and the expenditure of 5 Spirit Points.

A spell or feat may use one or multiple forms of defense negation, depending on its design. For instance, a spell might bypass only the target’s armor, or it might bypass both armor and the Active Defense ablative score. Some spells can negate all forms of defense, including armor, shielding, and Active Defense, by incorporating the appropriate challenge die rolls and Spirit Point expenditures. The specific combinations and requirements for defense negation are detailed within each spell’s description.

**Magical Backlash:** If a magic wielder lacks sufficient Spirit Points and overspends, it results in a magical backlash, directly reducing the caster’s Fortitude-based passive defense by an amount equal to the excess points spent.

**Saving Throws:** Saving throws are the last line of defense against defense negation effects. Generally, any effect that bypasses all possible modes of the Active Defense score (parry, dodge, or block) or deprives the target of agency in play qualifies for a saving throw. Examples include mind control, paralysis, forced teleportation, and effects that incapacitate or restrain.

Healing and Dying

Passive defense is a measure of how much physical punishment a character can take before dropping unconscious or dying. A character is unconscious when reaching a zero passive defense pool, but can survive damage up to a negative number equal to Fortitude’s Max Value. So, a PC with basic Fortitude of d8 will die at –8, and so on. 

Characters may roll Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality every round to keep going and avoid falling unconscious.

The Defense Pool Refresh Rates table shows how fast the various defense pools recover and under which conditions. 

Calculating Total Potential Harm

A character's total attack Potential Harm is determined by their weapon, specialization, and focus abilities. Threat and Ranged Threat focuses enhance melee and ranged attacks, respectively.

Using an Iconic Weapon increases threat points by +1 per level and allows the incorporation of a second focus (if possessed) based on the weapon's damage type (Might for Crushing, Ferocity for Slashing, or Speed for Impaling). Iconic Weapons, when used with a mastery die, can also trigger special a "master twist" effect, positively altering outcomes of an otherwise disappointing roll. See Iconic Weapons in the Equipment Chapter for details. 

Interpretations of Prowess Ability

Rules never trump character concepts. Whether the character concept is brawny, or merely fast and nimble is immaterial; if a PC uses a two-handed sword or a rapier, he is assumed to be strong or dexterous enough to wield it. If the player makes his character a weakling who cannot wield a certain weapon, that is fine. It may be that the PC prefers light, fast weapons, so his die rank is interpreted in terms of accuracy or quickness.

Increasing die rank in Prowess specialties represents increasing reflexes, force, accuracy, or blending of the three, depending on the attack method used. 

Chapter 4: Magic

Magic in the Eldritch RPG is considered rare but versatile and powerful. All magic channeled and manipulated by creatures of the universe is governed by the Competence ability, the Expertise specialty, and the feats of the spell casting classes. In most cases, the learning and casting of magic spells require the Gift of Magic advantage. This chapter explains spells, their paths (sources of power), and the rules underlying all magic in the game. Magic spells are incantations that tap into the weave of magic or invoke the gods' favor to cause various effects, whether beneficial or malign. Ritual magic uses arcane glyphs and runic symbols, usually inscribed into objects, to create items with various magical effects.

Learning Spells

For mages and adepts, the art of learning magic involves studying ancient grimoires and esoteric knowledge, tapping into the weave of magic inherent to a universe manifest from dreams. Dweomercraft, the tradition of wizards, is usually taught and practiced through mentorship.

Theurgists, on the other hand, channel magic fueled by prayer or ardent belief. Fealty and duty to the deities, whether within a formal priesthood or as a religious recluse, is one way the Gift of Magic is earned, with supernatural abilities a direct gift from a god or lesser servant.

Spell Casting

Spells are occult or religious incantations and rituals combining will and word to produce a defined result.

Mages, adepts, and mystics (collectively called wizards) call spells dweomers, while theurgists (priests, druids) call them miracles, but although names, power sources, and practitioners differ, all spells are cast in much the same way. The paths of magic are particular arcane or divine sources of magical knowledge and power, each with its own characteristic styles of offensive, defensive, and general-purpose spells. 

Spells are cast using Competence → Expertise (Wizardry or Theurgy).

Practitioners of magic tend to follow a specific path, and are familiar with that path’s named spells (those that have been written down and refined over the ages). This means they understand them in principle, even if they initially find some too difficult to cast. 

Spells learned and cast by those with the Gift of Magic do not cost spirit points unless the spell's description specifies a cost or involves defense negation, multi-effects, or casting an unlearned spell from a scroll or grimoire.

Initial Spell Selection:

At character creation, magic-wielders can choose a number of spells from any spell list based on their Competence → Expertise dice. They gain initial access to two spells for each die rank in Competence and in Expertise. 

For example, a character with a Competence of d6 and an Expertise of d4 would have a total of 3 die rank steps and access to 6 known spells. Adepts begin with half the initial spells of other magic-wielders, reflecting their focus on ritual magic and the crafting of magical items and potions, rather than on spell diversity.

These initial spells must be Common or Uncommon. 

Learning Higher Rarity Spells:

To learn Esoteric, Occult, or Legendary spells, characters must usually embark on quests or other adventures during the campaign. However, adventuring alone does not automatically add spells to a character’s repertoire. 

Increasing Spell Repertoire Slots:

Advancing in die ranks of either Competence or Expertise increases a character's ability to learn more spells of any rarity. Each time a character goes up in a die rank in either Competence or Expertise, he or she gains an additional two slots for their potential repertoire. 

These slots can be filled (with new spells learned or discovered) at the first narratively appropriate moment from any spell list

Learning Additional Spells:

Characters can add newly discovered spells or spells taught to them by characters of the same class to their repertoire by spending enough time and making an ability roll to learn the formula. However, magic-wielders can only learn new spells listed along with their character class. 

To learn a new spell from a teacher, scroll, or tome of magic, or through prayer or meditation, magic-wielders roll Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy against the spell’s challenge rating, which is determined by its rarity. The time it takes to learn a new spell (through transcription or memorization) is 5 days, adjusted down by one full day for every bonus point in Wizardry or Theurgy focus. Successfully learning the spell means adding it to the character's repertoire.

Level-Based Repertoire Increase:

All magic-wielding classes can choose one new path spell when advancing to their next character level. The rarity levels they may choose from for their bonus spell also increase with character level (Uncommon at 2nd level, Esoteric at 3rd, Occult at 4th, and Legendary at 5th). 

Activating a Spell

To cast a spell in the Eldritch RPG, practitioners must make a test. If the player’s total is equal to or higher than the challenge die roll, the magic takes effect (although success may depend on additional opposed rolls). A magic-wielder always rolls Competence → Expertise, adding any focus in Wizardry or Theurgy. Failing to meet or exceed the challenge die results in failure and may incur other penalties (see Spell Failure Table, page 85). 

The mastery die can be used on path spells a limited number of times per day in combat or challenging non-combat situations. 

Maintenance Penalty

Each spell maintained causes a penalty to any ability tests while concentrating on maintaining its magical effects. These penalties stack when maintaining multiple spell effects. 

The maximum duration of a maintained spell is equal to the caster's Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus maximum MV score in rounds. 

If a spell is maintained beyond this limit, a concentration check is required each additional round with a target number based on the spell's maintenance penalty. If the check fails, all spells fizzle. Instant spells cannot be maintained.

Spell Structure

The Gift of Magic advantage is the only prerequisite for learning spells or channeling magical energy. Membership in a magic-using class is not strictly required, although that is the only way to access specific class feats. The broadly known types of magic are Wizardry (mages and mystics), Theurgy (priests and druids) and Arcanum (artificing and ritual magic). Those without the Gift of Magic advantage have a rudimentary understanding of magic, allowing them to attempt to activate a spell from an inscribed item or written formulary. However, their ability to use magic is limited, and they risk an energy backlash if the attempt fails, potentially leading to lethal consequences.

Spell Descriptions

All spells use the following format: Spell name, Challenge—Rarity—Effect, Type/Target, and Description

Spell Name

The name simply identifies the spell. Named spells are those that have been written down and refined over the ages, and the common spells at least will be known about (if not necessarily learned) by practitioners of magic.

Spell Challenge

The challenge roll, except for Harm, determines the success of a spell. Harm spells require an attack roll, with modifications needing a challenge die roll. Even if modifications fail, basic harm remains.

Spell challenge, rarity, potency, and modifiers are interconnected. 

_Spell _Potency_

The challenge die corresponds to the spell's potency level, which determines its rarity. 

Each potency level has an associated modifier, either positive or negative.

**Potency Level 1:** d4 / Common / ±1

**Potency Level 2:** d6 / Uncommon / ±2

**Potency Level 3:** d8 / Esoteric / ±3

**Potency Level 4:** d10 / Occult / ±4

**Potency Level 5:** d12 or above / Legendary / ±5

For targets and areas of effect, refer to the Spell Challenge and Maintenance Penalty Table.

Spell Rarity

All spells are assigned a rarity level, either Common, Uncommon, Esoteric, Occult, or Legendary, which indicates not only their casting difficulty but also their likelihood of being found in treasure hoards, spellbooks, and the memories of NPCs.

Spell Effect

These give a quick indication of what the spell does: Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore. As explained in the section, these effects are building blocks of all spells.

**Activate** (in the sense of causing an event or a change) covers miscellaneous spells not fitting neatly into the other categories. -Effects include benefits like new temporary powers, divine favor, useful non-combat spells, luck, and so on. 

**Afflict** covers physical and mental abilities, from knocking someone prone to controlling their mind. 

**Harm** effects are magical attacks that sometimes incorporate afflictions. 

**Modify** effects either augment or curse abilities or equipment. 

**Protect** effects involve magic shielding and armor. 

**Restore** effects can heal and restore, eliminate fatigue, cure diseases, or even raise the dead, while the flip-side of this power, **Destroy**, includes spells that inflict damage or destruction, such as disintegration or corrosion spells, and those that corrupt or decay.

Type/Target

This starts with a brief notation in square brackets of the type/target.

**Duration Type:** There are two types of spell duration: M for maintainable and Inst for instantaneous. 

**Maintainable** spells, unlike instantaneous spells, last for one round (10 seconds) initially, and can be extended for a maximum number of rounds equal to the caster's MV in their relevant ability branch. Extending a spell incurs a Maintenance Penalty, affecting other ability tests, not attack rolls or threat points. The penalty increases for each round and each additional spell maintained, and its severity depends on the spell's challenge rank (from -1 for d4 spells to -5 for d12 spells). 

**Targets:** Spell targets determine the affected entities: **Self**, **Creature**, **Area**, or **Object**. Attack spells focus on single or multiple creatures, areas, and occasionally objects. 

They manifest as 1 ft-diameter bolts (mana or energy bolts, etc.) or 2 ft-wide streams (e.g., fire or other elemental attacks), both evadable through defense. Bolts deliver instantanous harm, while streams cause continuous harm or deter enemies.

Some spells influence multiple targets or areas, using the primary target as the default origin. Spell descriptions specify effects, conditions, and modifiers. To cast an attack spell, the caster must see the target or origin point. 

Magic Effects and Parameters

Other characteristics of a spell that are not listed with each spell entry usually rest on the ability test rather than individual spell differences. These characteristics tend to follow general rules and tables.

Spell Range and Area of Effect 

The maximum range for a spell or feat is determined by the caster’s ability in the relevant branch. This is calculated by taking the Maximum Value (MV) of the caster’s combined die ranks in the Competence → Expertise branch and multiplying it by 4. If the spell or feat is activated with a mastery die, this range is doubled.

The spell’s Area of Effect (AoE) is calculated by doubling the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV and adding their wizard or Theurgy bonus MV. The spell defines the shape of the AoE. If a mastery die activates the spell, its volume doubles.

**Maintained Effects:** Only some persistent spell effects can be maintained beyond the caster’s line of sight, indicated by individual spell or power (and increasing the maintenance penalty by at least –1 per round; GM fiat). 

**Touch-based Spells:** Modify spells to target creatures within reach, enhancing their success rate. These spells are occasionally designated as “Creature or Self,” assuming the creature is within touch range. In other cases, ranged spells can be changed into touch spells if the caster can physically make contact with the target, granting a +2 bonus on ability tests. The Game Master’s judgment is necessary to determine if a spell is eligible for modification. Keep communication lines open and provide thorough descriptions when the position of a target or the area of effect is ambiguous. 

Spell Casting Modifiers

Spell modifiers, unlike mage dweomers, modify the ability test when performed. The player rolls only once regardless of the attack and must meet or beat the challenge die result. Some spells present casting modifiers as options, and others are baked into the spell’s formula and unmalleable. 

**Increase Area of Effect:** Increases the area affected by the spell. Each die rank increase in the challenge die doubles the area of effect.

**Increase/Decrease Effect:** Modifies the intensity of the spell's effect. Each die rank increase in the challenge die adds +1 to the effect (up to +5).

**Bypass Armor/Shields:** Allows the spell to ignore some or all of the target's armor or shield. The challenge die rank equals the armor or shield's die rank.

**Change Duration:** Alters the duration of the spell. Each die rank increase in the challenge die increases the duration.

**Distributed Harm:** This casting modifier allows magic wielders to allocate the damage dice of a Harm spell among multiple targets. The caster divides the spell’s effect dice, ensuring that each target receives at least one whole die, and dice cannot be split further (e.g., a d8 cannot become two d4s). For example, a spell with 3d8 damage could assign 2d8 to one target and 1d8 to another or allocate 1d8 to each of three targets. The caster declares this distribution before rolling and then makes a single casting check. If the check succeeds, all targets take the allocated damage; failure causes the spell to fizzle entirely. This modifier applies only to Harm spells with discrete damage dice and excludes area-effect spells or those with secondary effects unless otherwise specified by the Game Master. Players must clearly communicate their dice allocation, and the Game Master should adjudicate any edge cases, such as interacting with spell effects beyond pure damage. 

Unlocking Ranked Spell Effects

Some spells include ranked effects that can only be activated by magic-wielders with a specific branch proficiency level. These ranked effects represent advanced spell potency and complexity, requiring a minimum branch rank to unlock. Not all casting modifiers are tied to branch proficiency; some have alternative costs or requirements, such as increased Spirit Point expenditure, additional material components, or longer casting times.

**Rank to Unlock Higher Rarity Effects**

Weak (1-3) d4 (Common)

Average (4+) d6 (Uncommon)

Respectable (12+) d8 (Esoteric)

Skilled (16+) d10 (Occult)

Great (20+) d12 (Legendary)

Phenomenal (24+) d12+ (Legendary+)

This table links a character’s branch rank to the potency level required to unlock higher-rarity effects in spells. Unlockable effects must be fixed-rank (not variable) and have a higher rarity than the base spell. For example, a character with a “Great” (20+) rank in Competence → Expertise → Wizardry could elevate a common spell to legendary potency.

As an example, the Arcane Maelstrom spell (d6—Rare—Harm) creates an arcane vortex that deals damage equal to the caster’s ability roll within its radius. A mastery die doubles the radius, and failure results in half-threat damage to all targets. With a Great (20+) rank, the caster can enhance the spell to bypass physical defenses and directly strike targets’ essence by succeeding on a d12 challenge roll, spending 12 Spirit Points, and using a mastery die. On failure, the spell reverts to standard damage, which is subject to normal defenses.

Varieties of Magical Manifestation

Eldritch RPG spells can take physical or non-physical forms. The default form is physical and visible, often appearing as a glowing substance. However, some spells may manifest as telekinetic or psychic energy, invisible to the naked eye. To effectively guide their magic-using characters, players must recognize these different manifestations.

Non-Physical Harm

Some spells, traps, and damage spells from the Intangible Threats feat inflict non-physical harm. Normal weapons, shields, or armor can't block it. However, if the magical attack can be seen or sensed, it can be dodged with active defense. Magical protections against preternatural and supernatural threats, along with enchanted equipment, are effective against non-physical harm.

Employing feats and spells that bypass defenses, such as ignoring armor, draining spirit points, or affecting defense pools, does not require a mastery die. **Bypassing Active Defenses or using afflictions that strip a target of agency, such as mind control, requires expending one daily mastery die**. 

Intense Manifestations

Certain spells can manifest with intense physical power, like superheated energy, bypassing armor and other standard defenses. These powerful manifestations require the caster to overcome a higher challenge die and expend additional resources, like Spirit Points and Mastery Dice.

For example, a Fire Bolt spell can be cast in a superheated form to melt through armor, ignoring its damage reduction. To achieve this, the caster must roll against a higher challenge die and spend additional Spirit Points if the spell's description permits such a modification.

Persistence of Magical Energy

When a spell fails, residual energy reverts to a basic, visible form, usually a glowing substance. The spell's enhancements are lost, leaving only the base damage. Area-effect spells become single-target eldritch bolts. Non-harmful or multi-effect spells fizzle with no lingering effect. Unless it's a class path spell, consult the full spell failure table. The caster can suppress the residual effect, but invoking magic always leaves a trace.

Multi-Effect Spells 

Multi-effect spells incorporate several effects, such as Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore. The spell’s final challenge rating is based on the highest die rank of all included effects, considering their rarity. Multi-effect spells also require the use of spirit points (as listed for the spell), making them more challenging to cast than a single-effect spell.

Multi-Effect Spells and Defense Negation 

Non-physical harm, caused by certain spells, magical traps, and harm spells linked with the Intangible Threats mage feat, bypasses conventional defenses. Normal weapons and armor are useless against it, but active defense can dodge it if the attack is perceivable. Magical protections and enchanted equipment work against non-physical harm.

To directly negate defenses like armor or drain spirit points, you need to use a mastery die and spend extra spirit points. The mastery die roll represents your willpower, and the spirit point cost depends on the defense's strength. 

Multi-Effect and Spirit Points 

In casting multi-effect spells, players have two options:

**Standard Casting:** The caster can roll against the challenge die for the primary effect of the spell. For each additional effect beyond the primary, the caster pays one spirit point per die-rank step (with a minimum of 1 spirit point for each extra effect).

**Quickening:** Alternatively, the caster can use Quickening for rapid casting of the spell. When using Quickening, the spirit point cost equals the maximum challenge die rank value of the primary effect plus 1 spirit point per additional effect. 

Quickening accelerates the casting of spells, forgoing the ability test required for spell activation, but still requires mages to perform challenge checks for specific enhancements or modifications made through Dweomers and Arcane Finesse. These feats, unique to mages, often involve spell alterations affecting casting modifiers such as bypassing defense or increasing harm, rather than the spell's core effects. Failure in these challenge checks, or insufficient spirit points, leads to backlash, converting spirit points into potential harm. 

Effect Failure and Consequences 

If a multi-effect spell’s primary effect fails, all additional effects fail. When any additional effects fail, consequences depend on the spell’s highest challenge rating. Players should consult the spell failure table for guidance. 

The Paths of Magic

Magic is a vast and complex field whose practitioners can be divided into two main groups: mages and theurgists. Mages have a deep understanding of preternatural and magical energies that allow them to control elemental forces, summon creatures, and manipulate space and time. Theurgists draw their power from the gods and use it to manipulate the natural world around them. Mystics, on the other hand, manipulate mental and spiritual energies to stretch the fabric of reality. The paths of magic are as follows:

**Elementalism (mage):** Elementalists have learned how to control the world’s material foundations and forces. They harness the power of Air, which includes wind and lightning; Earth, such as minerals, rocks, and crystals; Fire, including heat, flame, and light; Water, with its rain, currents, and waves; and Energy, which encompasses force, spirit, and the quintessence of power. 

**Druidry (theurgist):** Druids’ spiritual communion with nature grants them theurgical powers over the world of nature, encompassing plants, animals, and the physical world. Their connection extends to all living things beneath intelligent races and intersects with the chaos of weather patterns. 

**Hieraticism (theurgist):** Priests draw upon their devotion to the gods to channel the forces of life or entropy, where dreams, matter, and mind intersect. Priests of Light channel spiritual powers that quicken matter and sustain life, while Priests of Darkness spread death, decay, and advocate for the breakdown of systems. 

**Mysticism (Mystic):** Mystics are masters of the mind, controlling light and shadow, and operating at the intersection of chaos, magic, and order. They excel in manipulating mental and spiritual energies and delving into the fabric of reality. 

**Sorcery (mage):** Practitioners of sorcery deal in chaos, the phantasmagorical, and extra-dimensional realms. They manipulate thoughts, images, sensations, dimensions, space, time, planes, and magical travel. Sorcerers are adept at reality settling or unsettling, disorder, luck, and randomness. 

**Thaumaturgy (mage):** Thaumaturges bend reality and can alter matter and time, challenging cosmic order to affect their surroundings and fates. They are skilled in manipulating primal forces, using telekinetic and reality-warping abilities to attain their wishes. 

The Six Magic Effects

The Magic Effects are the backbone of magic in Eldritch RPG. Each path utilizes these effects in unique ways.

**Activate:** This effect serves as the catalyst for magical events. It covers a broad spectrum from summoning creatures and teleporting objects to creating and manipulating energies, and even setting up contingent magic like traps and wards.

**Afflict:** These spells directly impact a target's physical or mental state, often requiring saving throws to resist. Mental afflictions disrupt thoughts and emotions, while physical afflictions hinder movement and capabilities.

**Harm:** These spells inflict direct damage in the form of Threat Points. They can range from elemental attacks like fire and ice to arcane energy blasts and psychic assaults.

**Modify:** Spells in this category alter the properties of creatures, objects, or the environment. They can enhance or hinder abilities, manipulate senses, or even transmute one substance into another.

**Protect:** This effect focuses on bolstering defenses and mitigating damage. It encompasses magical barriers, armor enhancement, and immunities to specific types of harm.

**Restore/Destroy:** This effect category embodies the duality of creation and destruction. It includes spells that heal, cure diseases, or even restore life, as well as those that inflict debilitating conditions, accelerate decay, or obliterate matter.

**Cross-Discipline Spellcasting:** Characters with the Gift of Magic can learn a limited number of spells from a secondary focus within their Expertise specialty. The number of spells learnable equals their focus bonus in the secondary focus. For example, a Mage with a +3 Theurgy focus could learn up to three Theurgy spells, provided they have the necessary training or resources (like finding a spellbook or receiving instruction from a Theurgist)

**Discovering New Spells**

The elf mage Taldoran finds a scroll with unknown runes in ancient ruins. The GM tells him it's an Esoteric spell. After five days, Taldoran (Competence d10, Expertise d8, Wizardry +3) deciphers the scroll and adds the new spell to his repertoire.

Spell Failure

The penalty in the table applies if the ability test roll fails when the magic-wielder attempts to cast a spell. This does not apply to class-based chosen path spells. Note that using the mastery die with non-path spells does not negate the risk of spell failure as outlined in the Spell Failure Table.

Those magic-wielders lacking the Gift of Magic also suffer threat points equal to the result of the failed roll immediately affecting their passive defense pool. 

Concentration Check

When a magic-wielder is attacked or otherwise disrupted while maintaining a spell, they must make a concentration check to avoid losing the spell. The concentration check is a Competence → Expertise (Wizardry or Theurgy) roll against a target number set by the GM, usually based on the severity of the disruption.

Magic Use Scenarios

**_Scenario 1: Mage's Defense Negation_**

Dannumara, a seasoned mage, faced off against Eldric, a legendary warrior who had stolen a powerful magical scroll. Eldric’s exceptional speed (d12; battle phase 1) allowed him to act first. Despite lacking the Gift of Magic, Eldric attempted to cast an Arcane Maelstrom spell from a stolen scroll. Eldric rolled his Competence (d8) and general Expertise (d6; conceptualized as occult knowledge but lacking Gift of Magic), and added his Iconic Weapon bonus (+2). His total roll was 11 (5 on d8, 4 on d6, +2 bonus) against the spell’s formidable d12 challenge. His total roll was 9, and the attempt failed. The residual magical energy still streaked across the battlefield and manifested as a weaker bolt of harmful mana (as per Persistence of Magic Energy rules), but Dannumara, prepared for such an eventuality, waved it away with a short incantation (i.e., the player creatively described how she used her Active Defense to absorb the impact). Eldric’s failure and lack of magical prowess caused a severe backlash; he lost Spirit Points equal to the spell’s challenge die (12) and suffered 12 points of psychic damage directly to his Passive Defense, reducing him to 8 HP. He gasped and dropped his weapon.

Seizing the moment, Dannumara retaliated with a _Fire Bolt_ spell. She rolled her Competence (d10), Expertise (d10), added her Wizardry Focus (+3), and included her Mastery Die (d8), achieving an impressive roll totaling 24 threat points (7 on d10, 8 on d10, +3 focus, 6 on d8). Given that her minimum possible roll exceeded the maximum of the challenge die (d4), the challenge roll was omitted. Thus, a bolt of fire erupted from Dannumara’s fingertip, striking with overwhelming force, depleting her foe’s remaining hit points, driving his Passive score far into the negative, and blasting the life out of his body.

**_Scenario 2: Sorcerer's Multi-Effect Spell_**

In the heart of a dense, primeval forest, Aric found himself surrounded by bandits. Though a third-level mage, he had Deluge from the Elementalism Path—a powerful control spell.

With a quick incantation, Aric channeled his Spirit Points and summoned a downpour. His casting roll of 24, boosted by his Elementalism Focus (+3) and Mastery Die (d8), easily surpassed the challenge roll of 15. Water surged into the clearing, covering a 20-foot radius and turning the ground into a swamp.

The bandits, caught in the sudden flood, struggled to move as the water rose to knee level. Their speed was halved, and their footing faltered in the muck. As the floodwaters surged through the clearing, the Bandit Leader struggled to stay upright, caught off guard by the sudden torrent. Desperately, he attempted a saving throw, rolling a d6. The result was a 3—far too low to resist the overwhelming force of the flood. Swept off his feet, he was dragged into the swirling water, leaving him and his men disoriented and vulnerable.

Aric, unscathed, stood ready as the battlefield shifted to his advantage, the bandits slowed and vulnerable in the flooded terrain.

**_Scenario 3: Mystic's Feat-Enhanced Spell_**

In the ruins of an ancient temple, Seraphina, a powerful mystic, prepared to face the Guardian Spirit. To ensure the flawless execution of her Mystic Bolt spell, she utilized her Path Mastery (Mysticism) feat, eliminating the chance of serious consequence to spell failure.

Seraphina's rolls were exceptional: Competence (d12) yielded 11, Expertise (d10) resulted in 8, her Mysticism Focus added +4, and her Mastery Die (d10) contributed 9. This impressive total of 32 far surpassed the spell's d8 challenge die, guaranteeing its success.

The Mystic Bolt, a surge of pure psychic energy, hurtled towards the Guardian Spirit. The spirit's attempts to defend itself proved futile as the bolt, being psychic in nature, bypassed its defenses entirely. The spell inflicted a devastating 32 points of damage directly to the spirit's Hit Points, leaving it severely weakened.

The Guardian Spirit, though injured, retaliated with its spectral touch attack, rolling a total of 7 on 2d6. Seraphina, harnessing the mystical energies surrounding her, utilized her Active Defense, fortified by elements of her known spells, to conjure a shimmering barrier. The barrier's strength was more than enough to absorb the 7 points of damage from the spirit's attack.

Pressing her advantage, Seraphina cast another Mystic Bolt on her next turn. Her roll of 28 once again guaranteed the spell's success. The 28 points of damage overwhelmed the Guardian Spirit's remaining Hit Points, causing it to dissipate with an otherworldly wail.

**Integrating Spell Aspects into Active Defense**

Players may describe their character’s defensive actions using elements of their known spells as long as these actions primarily use Active Defense Points and fit within the character's abilities and the context of the situation. Magic Defense provided by the Tier 2 Gift of Magic remains a distinct ability specifically for non-physical magical harm and should not be confused with general Active Defense actions (see Gift of Magic, page 22). 

Chapter 4: Magic

Magic in the Eldritch RPG is considered rare but versatile and powerful. All magic channeled and manipulated by creatures of the universe is governed by the Competence ability, the Expertise specialty, and the feats of the spell casting classes. In most cases, the learning and casting of magic spells require the Gift of Magic advantage. This chapter explains spells, their paths (sources of power), and the rules underlying all magic in the game. Magic spells are incantations that tap into the weave of magic or invoke the gods' favor to cause various effects, whether beneficial or malign. Ritual magic uses arcane glyphs and runic symbols, usually inscribed into objects, to create items with various magical effects.

Learning Spells

For mages and adepts, the art of learning magic involves studying ancient grimoires and esoteric knowledge, tapping into the weave of magic inherent to a universe manifest from dreams. Dweomercraft, the tradition of wizards, is usually taught and practiced through mentorship.

Theurgists, on the other hand, channel magic fueled by prayer or ardent belief. Fealty and duty to the deities, whether within a formal priesthood or as a religious recluse, is one way the Gift of Magic is earned, with supernatural abilities a direct gift from a god or lesser servant.

Spell Casting

Spells are occult or religious incantations and rituals combining will and word to produce a defined result.

Mages, adepts, and mystics (collectively called wizards) call spells dweomers, while theurgists (priests, druids) call them miracles, but although names, power sources, and practitioners differ, all spells are cast in much the same way. The paths of magic are particular arcane or divine sources of magical knowledge and power, each with its own characteristic styles of offensive, defensive, and general-purpose spells. 

Spells are cast using Competence → Expertise (Wizardry or Theurgy).

Practitioners of magic tend to follow a specific path, and are familiar with that path’s named spells (those that have been written down and refined over the ages). This means they understand them in principle, even if they initially find some too difficult to cast. 

Spells learned and cast by those with the Gift of Magic do not cost spirit points unless the spell's description specifies a cost or involves defense negation, multi-effects, or casting an unlearned spell from a scroll or grimoire.

Initial Spell Selection:

At character creation, magic-wielders can choose a number of spells from any spell list based on their Competence → Expertise dice. They gain initial access to two spells for each die rank in Competence and in Expertise. 

For example, a character with a Competence of d6 and an Expertise of d4 would have a total of 3 die rank steps and access to 6 known spells. Adepts begin with half the initial spells of other magic-wielders, reflecting their focus on ritual magic and the crafting of magical items and potions, rather than on spell diversity.

These initial spells must be Common or Uncommon. 

Learning Higher Rarity Spells:

To learn Esoteric, Occult, or Legendary spells, characters must usually embark on quests or other adventures during the campaign. However, adventuring alone does not automatically add spells to a character’s repertoire. 

Increasing Spell Repertoire Slots:

Advancing in die ranks of either Competence or Expertise increases a character's ability to learn more spells of any rarity. Each time a character goes up in a die rank in either Competence or Expertise, he or she gains an additional two slots for their potential repertoire. 

These slots can be filled (with new spells learned or discovered) at the first narratively appropriate moment from any spell list

Learning Additional Spells:

Characters can add newly discovered spells or spells taught to them by characters of the same class to their repertoire by spending enough time and making an ability roll to learn the formula. However, magic-wielders can only learn new spells listed along with their character class. 

To learn a new spell from a teacher, scroll, or tome of magic, or through prayer or meditation, magic-wielders roll Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy against the spell’s challenge rating, which is determined by its rarity. The time it takes to learn a new spell (through transcription or memorization) is 5 days, adjusted down by one full day for every bonus point in Wizardry or Theurgy focus. Successfully learning the spell means adding it to the character's repertoire.

Level-Based Repertoire Increase:

All magic-wielding classes can choose one new path spell when advancing to their next character level. The rarity levels they may choose from for their bonus spell also increase with character level (Uncommon at 2nd level, Esoteric at 3rd, Occult at 4th, and Legendary at 5th). 

Activating a Spell

To cast a spell in the Eldritch RPG, practitioners must make a test. If the player’s total is equal to or higher than the challenge die roll, the magic takes effect (although success may depend on additional opposed rolls). A magic-wielder always rolls Competence → Expertise, adding any focus in Wizardry or Theurgy. Failing to meet or exceed the challenge die results in failure and may incur other penalties (see Spell Failure Table, page 85). 

The mastery die can be used on path spells a limited number of times per day in combat or challenging non-combat situations. 

Maintenance Penalty

Each spell maintained causes a penalty to any ability tests while concentrating on maintaining its magical effects. These penalties stack when maintaining multiple spell effects. 

The maximum duration of a maintained spell is equal to the caster's Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus maximum MV score in rounds. 

If a spell is maintained beyond this limit, a concentration check is required each additional round with a target number based on the spell's maintenance penalty. If the check fails, all spells fizzle. Instant spells cannot be maintained.

Spell Structure

The Gift of Magic advantage is the only prerequisite for learning spells or channeling magical energy. Membership in a magic-using class is not strictly required, although that is the only way to access specific class feats. The broadly known types of magic are Wizardry (mages and mystics), Theurgy (priests and druids) and Arcanum (artificing and ritual magic). Those without the Gift of Magic advantage have a rudimentary understanding of magic, allowing them to attempt to activate a spell from an inscribed item or written formulary. However, their ability to use magic is limited, and they risk an energy backlash if the attempt fails, potentially leading to lethal consequences.

Spell Descriptions

All spells use the following format: Spell name, Challenge—Rarity—Effect, Type/Target, and Description

Spell Name

The name simply identifies the spell. Named spells are those that have been written down and refined over the ages, and the common spells at least will be known about (if not necessarily learned) by practitioners of magic.

Spell Challenge

The challenge roll, except for Harm, determines the success of a spell. Harm spells require an attack roll, with modifications needing a challenge die roll. Even if modifications fail, basic harm remains.

Spell challenge, rarity, potency, and modifiers are interconnected. 

_Spell _Potency_

The challenge die corresponds to the spell's potency level, which determines its rarity. 

Each potency level has an associated modifier, either positive or negative.

**Potency Level 1:** d4 / Common / ±1

**Potency Level 2:** d6 / Uncommon / ±2

**Potency Level 3:** d8 / Esoteric / ±3

**Potency Level 4:** d10 / Occult / ±4

**Potency Level 5:** d12 or above / Legendary / ±5

For targets and areas of effect, refer to the Spell Challenge and Maintenance Penalty Table.

Spell Rarity

All spells are assigned a rarity level, either Common, Uncommon, Esoteric, Occult, or Legendary, which indicates not only their casting difficulty but also their likelihood of being found in treasure hoards, spellbooks, and the memories of NPCs.

Spell Effect

These give a quick indication of what the spell does: Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore. As explained in the section, these effects are building blocks of all spells.

**Activate** (in the sense of causing an event or a change) covers miscellaneous spells not fitting neatly into the other categories. -Effects include benefits like new temporary powers, divine favor, useful non-combat spells, luck, and so on. 

**Afflict** covers physical and mental abilities, from knocking someone prone to controlling their mind. 

**Harm** effects are magical attacks that sometimes incorporate afflictions. 

**Modify** effects either augment or curse abilities or equipment. 

**Protect** effects involve magic shielding and armor. 

**Restore** effects can heal and restore, eliminate fatigue, cure diseases, or even raise the dead, while the flip-side of this power, **Destroy**, includes spells that inflict damage or destruction, such as disintegration or corrosion spells, and those that corrupt or decay.

Type/Target

This starts with a brief notation in square brackets of the type/target.

**Duration Type:** There are two types of spell duration: M for maintainable and Inst for instantaneous. 

**Maintainable** spells, unlike instantaneous spells, last for one round (10 seconds) initially, and can be extended for a maximum number of rounds equal to the caster's MV in their relevant ability branch. Extending a spell incurs a Maintenance Penalty, affecting other ability tests, not attack rolls or threat points. The penalty increases for each round and each additional spell maintained, and its severity depends on the spell's challenge rank (from -1 for d4 spells to -5 for d12 spells). 

**Targets:** Spell targets determine the affected entities: **Self**, **Creature**, **Area**, or **Object**. Attack spells focus on single or multiple creatures, areas, and occasionally objects. 

They manifest as 1 ft-diameter bolts (mana or energy bolts, etc.) or 2 ft-wide streams (e.g., fire or other elemental attacks), both evadable through defense. Bolts deliver instantanous harm, while streams cause continuous harm or deter enemies.

Some spells influence multiple targets or areas, using the primary target as the default origin. Spell descriptions specify effects, conditions, and modifiers. To cast an attack spell, the caster must see the target or origin point. 

Magic Effects and Parameters

Other characteristics of a spell that are not listed with each spell entry usually rest on the ability test rather than individual spell differences. These characteristics tend to follow general rules and tables.

Spell Range and Area of Effect 

The maximum range for a spell or feat is determined by the caster’s ability in the relevant branch. This is calculated by taking the Maximum Value (MV) of the caster’s combined die ranks in the Competence → Expertise branch and multiplying it by 4. If the spell or feat is activated with a mastery die, this range is doubled.

The spell’s Area of Effect (AoE) is calculated by doubling the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV and adding their wizard or Theurgy bonus MV. The spell defines the shape of the AoE. If a mastery die activates the spell, its volume doubles.

**Maintained Effects:** Only some persistent spell effects can be maintained beyond the caster’s line of sight, indicated by individual spell or power (and increasing the maintenance penalty by at least –1 per round; GM fiat). 

**Touch-based Spells:** Modify spells to target creatures within reach, enhancing their success rate. These spells are occasionally designated as “Creature or Self,” assuming the creature is within touch range. In other cases, ranged spells can be changed into touch spells if the caster can physically make contact with the target, granting a +2 bonus on ability tests. The Game Master’s judgment is necessary to determine if a spell is eligible for modification. Keep communication lines open and provide thorough descriptions when the position of a target or the area of effect is ambiguous. 

Spell Casting Modifiers

Spell modifiers, unlike mage dweomers, modify the ability test when performed. The player rolls only once regardless of the attack and must meet or beat the challenge die result. Some spells present casting modifiers as options, and others are baked into the spell’s formula and unmalleable. 

**Increase Area of Effect:** Increases the area affected by the spell. Each die rank increase in the challenge die doubles the area of effect.

**Increase/Decrease Effect:** Modifies the intensity of the spell's effect. Each die rank increase in the challenge die adds +1 to the effect (up to +5).

**Bypass Armor/Shields:** Allows the spell to ignore some or all of the target's armor or shield. The challenge die rank equals the armor or shield's die rank.

**Change Duration:** Alters the duration of the spell. Each die rank increase in the challenge die increases the duration.

**Distributed Harm:** This casting modifier allows magic wielders to allocate the damage dice of a Harm spell among multiple targets. The caster divides the spell’s effect dice, ensuring that each target receives at least one whole die, and dice cannot be split further (e.g., a d8 cannot become two d4s). For example, a spell with 3d8 damage could assign 2d8 to one target and 1d8 to another or allocate 1d8 to each of three targets. The caster declares this distribution before rolling and then makes a single casting check. If the check succeeds, all targets take the allocated damage; failure causes the spell to fizzle entirely. This modifier applies only to Harm spells with discrete damage dice and excludes area-effect spells or those with secondary effects unless otherwise specified by the Game Master. Players must clearly communicate their dice allocation, and the Game Master should adjudicate any edge cases, such as interacting with spell effects beyond pure damage. 

Unlocking Ranked Spell Effects

Some spells include ranked effects that can only be activated by magic-wielders with a specific branch proficiency level. These ranked effects represent advanced spell potency and complexity, requiring a minimum branch rank to unlock. Not all casting modifiers are tied to branch proficiency; some have alternative costs or requirements, such as increased Spirit Point expenditure, additional material components, or longer casting times.

**Rank to Unlock Higher Rarity Effects**

Weak (1-3) d4 (Common)

Average (4+) d6 (Uncommon)

Respectable (12+) d8 (Esoteric)

Skilled (16+) d10 (Occult)

Great (20+) d12 (Legendary)

Phenomenal (24+) d12+ (Legendary+)

This table links a character’s branch rank to the potency level required to unlock higher-rarity effects in spells. Unlockable effects must be fixed-rank (not variable) and have a higher rarity than the base spell. For example, a character with a “Great” (20+) rank in Competence → Expertise → Wizardry could elevate a common spell to legendary potency.

As an example, the Arcane Maelstrom spell (d6—Rare—Harm) creates an arcane vortex that deals damage equal to the caster’s ability roll within its radius. A mastery die doubles the radius, and failure results in half-threat damage to all targets. With a Great (20+) rank, the caster can enhance the spell to bypass physical defenses and directly strike targets’ essence by succeeding on a d12 challenge roll, spending 12 Spirit Points, and using a mastery die. On failure, the spell reverts to standard damage, which is subject to normal defenses.

Varieties of Magical Manifestation

Eldritch RPG spells can take physical or non-physical forms. The default form is physical and visible, often appearing as a glowing substance. However, some spells may manifest as telekinetic or psychic energy, invisible to the naked eye. To effectively guide their magic-using characters, players must recognize these different manifestations.

Non-Physical Harm

Some spells, traps, and damage spells from the Intangible Threats feat inflict non-physical harm. Normal weapons, shields, or armor can't block it. However, if the magical attack can be seen or sensed, it can be dodged with active defense. Magical protections against preternatural and supernatural threats, along with enchanted equipment, are effective against non-physical harm.

Employing feats and spells that bypass defenses, such as ignoring armor, draining spirit points, or affecting defense pools, does not require a mastery die. **Bypassing Active Defenses or using afflictions that strip a target of agency, such as mind control, requires expending one daily mastery die**. 

Intense Manifestations

Certain spells can manifest with intense physical power, like superheated energy, bypassing armor and other standard defenses. These powerful manifestations require the caster to overcome a higher challenge die and expend additional resources, like Spirit Points and Mastery Dice.

For example, a Fire Bolt spell can be cast in a superheated form to melt through armor, ignoring its damage reduction. To achieve this, the caster must roll against a higher challenge die and spend additional Spirit Points if the spell's description permits such a modification.

Persistence of Magical Energy

When a spell fails, residual energy reverts to a basic, visible form, usually a glowing substance. The spell's enhancements are lost, leaving only the base damage. Area-effect spells become single-target eldritch bolts. Non-harmful or multi-effect spells fizzle with no lingering effect. Unless it's a class path spell, consult the full spell failure table. The caster can suppress the residual effect, but invoking magic always leaves a trace.

Multi-Effect Spells 

Multi-effect spells incorporate several effects, such as Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore. The spell’s final challenge rating is based on the highest die rank of all included effects, considering their rarity. Multi-effect spells also require the use of spirit points (as listed for the spell), making them more challenging to cast than a single-effect spell.

Multi-Effect Spells and Defense Negation 

Non-physical harm, caused by certain spells, magical traps, and harm spells linked with the Intangible Threats mage feat, bypasses conventional defenses. Normal weapons and armor are useless against it, but active defense can dodge it if the attack is perceivable. Magical protections and enchanted equipment work against non-physical harm.

To directly negate defenses like armor or drain spirit points, you need to use a mastery die and spend extra spirit points. The mastery die roll represents your willpower, and the spirit point cost depends on the defense's strength. 

Multi-Effect and Spirit Points 

In casting multi-effect spells, players have two options:

**Standard Casting:** The caster can roll against the challenge die for the primary effect of the spell. For each additional effect beyond the primary, the caster pays one spirit point per die-rank step (with a minimum of 1 spirit point for each extra effect).

**Quickening:** Alternatively, the caster can use Quickening for rapid casting of the spell. When using Quickening, the spirit point cost equals the maximum challenge die rank value of the primary effect plus 1 spirit point per additional effect. 

Quickening accelerates the casting of spells, forgoing the ability test required for spell activation, but still requires mages to perform challenge checks for specific enhancements or modifications made through Dweomers and Arcane Finesse. These feats, unique to mages, often involve spell alterations affecting casting modifiers such as bypassing defense or increasing harm, rather than the spell's core effects. Failure in these challenge checks, or insufficient spirit points, leads to backlash, converting spirit points into potential harm. 

Effect Failure and Consequences 

If a multi-effect spell’s primary effect fails, all additional effects fail. When any additional effects fail, consequences depend on the spell’s highest challenge rating. Players should consult the spell failure table for guidance. 

The Paths of Magic

Magic is a vast and complex field whose practitioners can be divided into two main groups: mages and theurgists. Mages have a deep understanding of preternatural and magical energies that allow them to control elemental forces, summon creatures, and manipulate space and time. Theurgists draw their power from the gods and use it to manipulate the natural world around them. Mystics, on the other hand, manipulate mental and spiritual energies to stretch the fabric of reality. The paths of magic are as follows:

**Elementalism (mage):** Elementalists have learned how to control the world’s material foundations and forces. They harness the power of Air, which includes wind and lightning; Earth, such as minerals, rocks, and crystals; Fire, including heat, flame, and light; Water, with its rain, currents, and waves; and Energy, which encompasses force, spirit, and the quintessence of power. 

**Druidry (theurgist):** Druids’ spiritual communion with nature grants them theurgical powers over the world of nature, encompassing plants, animals, and the physical world. Their connection extends to all living things beneath intelligent races and intersects with the chaos of weather patterns. 

**Hieraticism (theurgist):** Priests draw upon their devotion to the gods to channel the forces of life or entropy, where dreams, matter, and mind intersect. Priests of Light channel spiritual powers that quicken matter and sustain life, while Priests of Darkness spread death, decay, and advocate for the breakdown of systems. 

**Mysticism (Mystic):** Mystics are masters of the mind, controlling light and shadow, and operating at the intersection of chaos, magic, and order. They excel in manipulating mental and spiritual energies and delving into the fabric of reality. 

**Sorcery (mage):** Practitioners of sorcery deal in chaos, the phantasmagorical, and extra-dimensional realms. They manipulate thoughts, images, sensations, dimensions, space, time, planes, and magical travel. Sorcerers are adept at reality settling or unsettling, disorder, luck, and randomness. 

**Thaumaturgy (mage):** Thaumaturges bend reality and can alter matter and time, challenging cosmic order to affect their surroundings and fates. They are skilled in manipulating primal forces, using telekinetic and reality-warping abilities to attain their wishes. 

The Six Magic Effects

The Magic Effects are the backbone of magic in Eldritch RPG. Each path utilizes these effects in unique ways.

**Activate:** This effect serves as the catalyst for magical events. It covers a broad spectrum from summoning creatures and teleporting objects to creating and manipulating energies, and even setting up contingent magic like traps and wards.

**Afflict:** These spells directly impact a target's physical or mental state, often requiring saving throws to resist. Mental afflictions disrupt thoughts and emotions, while physical afflictions hinder movement and capabilities.

**Harm:** These spells inflict direct damage in the form of Threat Points. They can range from elemental attacks like fire and ice to arcane energy blasts and psychic assaults.

**Modify:** Spells in this category alter the properties of creatures, objects, or the environment. They can enhance or hinder abilities, manipulate senses, or even transmute one substance into another.

**Protect:** This effect focuses on bolstering defenses and mitigating damage. It encompasses magical barriers, armor enhancement, and immunities to specific types of harm.

**Restore/Destroy:** This effect category embodies the duality of creation and destruction. It includes spells that heal, cure diseases, or even restore life, as well as those that inflict debilitating conditions, accelerate decay, or obliterate matter.

Spells for All Paths

Those with the Gift of Magic possess an innate understanding of spells not tied to a specific path. These spells, while accessible to all with the Gift, are distinct from Path Spells. Path Spells are unique to a specific magical path, offering specialized abilities and effects. In contrast, these general spells are more foundational, providing a baseline of magical capability for any magic-wielder.

**Dispel Effect:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** Often used to dispel magical barriers such as shields, walls and armor, this spell has many variations, one version per magic path and per effect (Afflict, Modify, etc.) dispelled. Dispel Effect cannot undo or reverse instant spells like Fire Bolt. The effect dispelled must be in the same path or the dispel won’t work, which may require identification first.

After beating the challenge die with a single roll of the dice involved with the character’s ability test, that same roll is used to check against any subsequent opposing die roll challenges based on the other caster’s spell rarity (or the rarity of a magic item or trap’s effect): Common d4; Uncommon d6; Esoteric d8; Occult d10; Legendary d12.

_Game Master Advice_: The Game Master can make up the original rarity of the spell that generated something that can be dispelled on the spot if desired, have it written down in advance, or refer to an NPC’s abilities. The Game Master would then roll the challenge die to dispel the targeted magical effect inhibiting the player characters’ progress. The player character may have a chance to figure out the original rarity of the spell through game play.

**Identify Magic:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** Can detect and identify magic emanations. The magic-user rolls Competence → Expertise to detect local magic. A roll above 2 detects magic emanations if present somewhere nearby. A roll above 4 detects the general strength and direction of magic emanations (weak or strong, near or far).

A result of 8 reveals the precise strength and location of magic effects. A result of 10 also identifies the path associated with the effect, and a roll above 12 also detects magic type (effect). Rolling above 14 also identifies a specific magic-wielder spell signature (even if that caster is unknown), and above 20 also detects triggers on contingency spells and traps with magic detection shielding.

**Eldritch Bolt:** Auto (Variable)— Common—Harm 

**Description:** [Instant / Creature] A bolt of eldritch energy that can take myriad forms, depending on the type of magic used. This fundamental attack spell is inherent to all magic-wielders, and they can choose to enhance its potency by incorporating their mastery die into the casting. It manifests as a 1 ft-diameter bolt, delivering immediate potential harm. 

**For example:**

**• Druidry:** Coalescing, swirling thorny roots and earth form an orb of natural energy, entwining with vines and branches to create an organic shell that rolls forward with an earthy rumble.

**• Elementalism:** A globular bolt of blazing fire, crackling electricity, freezing ice, solid earth, or coruscating energy hurtles towards its target, infused with elemental power.

**• Hieraticism:** A radiant sphere of holy light, radiating divine brilliance, is accompanied by a low, humming sound as it swiftly streaks to its destination.

**• Mysticism:** A swirling orb of telekinetic force, pulsating with power, defies gravity and pulls nearby objects into its chaotic field of debris as it dashes towards its mark.

**• Sorcery:** A dark, swirling sphere of malevolent energy, surrounded by an aura of shadows and crackling with suppressed power, leaves an eerie trail as it flies.

**• Thaumaturgy:** An unpredictable sphere of energy zigzags forward, warping reality with erratic movements, distorting the surroundings and accompanied by dissonant echoing sounds.

**Eldritch Defense:** d4 - Common - Protect

**Description:** The caster creates a protective barrier or armor around themselves or a chosen target. The form of this defense depends on the caster’s magical path, providing either enhanced armor or magical shielding that reduces threat points from incoming attacks. The spell can be customized by each caster's magic path and grows more potent with higher ranks of proficiency.

**Armor:** Adds a layer of magical protection to the target, providing an additional defense pool (in DR points).

**Shielding:** Reduces incoming threat points before they affect the target’s defenses.

**Potential Effects:**

**Armor:** Provides DR (damage reduction) equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a maximum of +4 DR at d10.

**Shielding:** Reduces threat points from incoming attacks by the Challenge Die rank. A d4 Eldritch Shield reduces threat by 1, d6 by 2, d8 by 3, and d10 by 4.

**Maintenance:** The spell can be maintained by the caster, but they take a cumulative –1 penalty to other actions per additional round it is sustained.

**Customization by Path:**

**Elementalism:** The shield manifests as a barrier of the chosen element (e.g., a wall of flame, swirling air, or a hard shell of earth).

**Druidry:** Natural elements like vines, bark, or stones form a protective layer around the target.

**Hieraticism:** The shield takes the form of radiant divine energy, glowing with the light of a deity or holy power.

**Mysticism:** The defense is a psychic or telekinetic force field that repels attacks and shields the mind.

**Sorcery:** The protection is a swirling shadow or dark energy, deflecting attacks or weakening them before they hit.

**Thaumaturgy:** A chaotic and shimmering distortion in space, warping reality around the target to absorb and deflect attacks.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:**

**Each casting requires 1 SP for every rank of the Challenge Die. So, a d4 costs 1 SP, a d6** costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for a d12.

Elementalism

Offense Spells

**Elemental Assault:** d4-d12—Variable—Harm

**Description:** Elementalists use Elemental Bolt as their base offensive spell, choosing an elemental manifestation (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, or Energy). This spell can be modified and enhanced using the following options:

**Range and Dimensions**

**Maximum Range:** Calculated as (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Eldritch Bolt:** A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a single target.

**Eldritch Stream:** A continuous stream of energy with a width of 2 feet and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Eldritch Burst:** An area-of-effect attack with a radius of (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry bonuses in feet.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

**Stream:** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires an ongoing maintenance penalty of –1 per additional round.

Burst: Converts the spell to affect an area, increasing the Challenge Die (e.g., d4 to d8).

**• Afflictions:** Elementalists can add one affliction to the attack, which immediately affects the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and costs additional Spirit Points.

**Afflictions**

**Slow (Challenge d4):** This affliction can manifest as a chilling frost enveloping the target, numbing their limbs; fiery heat distorting the air, causing disorientation; electrical currents interfering with the nervous system; earthen weight pulling at the body; or arcane energy disrupting the target's connection to time. Regardless of the elemental manifestation, the effect reduces their initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one full step, for example, from d10 to d8). Increase the difficulty of the magic-wielder's test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced accordingly. This affliction, when caused by an instant spell, typically lasts for one round unless the specific spell description states otherwise.

**Knock Prone or Knock Back (Challenge d6):** This effect might appear as a powerful gust of wind sweeping the target off their feet, a surge of water crashing into them, a tremor in the earth unbalancing them, a burst of flame creating an explosive force, or a pulse of arcane energy pushing against them. The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back, depending on the spell or feat used. For spells, knockback distance is determined by the caster's Willpower die rank in feet, reflecting their control over magical energy (e.g., 1d8 feet for a d8 Willpower). For feats, knockback may be based on the attacker's Strength die rank. A successful save avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the target ends within another creature's reach. As an instant effect, the knockback or prone condition is typically resolved immediately, with the target able to stand or move normally on their next turn unless otherwise specified.

**Stun (Challenge d8):** The stunning effect could be caused by a sudden burst of lightning short-circuiting the target's senses, a concussive blast of air pressure disorienting them, searing heat causing momentary shock to their system, a crushing force of earth energy overwhelming them, or a flash of pure magical energy overloading their mind. Regardless of the cause, the target may not move or attack for one full round. It is considered temporarily incapacitated and may be more vulnerable to certain effects or attacks. When caused by an instant spell, this stun effect typically lasts for one round unless the specific spell description indicates a longer duration.

**Debilitate Sense (Challenge d10):** This affliction severely compromises or overloads a target's sensory perception. Most Competence → Perception checks using the affected sense automatically fail, with possible –5 penalty for compensation attempts. It significantly impairs environmental interaction and threat detection. Attacks by affected characters suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm, reducing threat points generated. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability, this often results in minimal or no threat points. Instant spell effects typically last one round unless specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Elementalists harness the fundamental forces of nature through Elemental Shield and Elemental Armor, crafting defenses that are both versatile and tailored to the specific threats they face. These spells draw upon the natural elements—Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Energy—to provide robust protection, adapting dynamically to the ebb and flow of combat.

**Elemental Shield:** (d4 to d12 — Common to Legendary — Protect)

**Description:** The Elementalist conjures a barrier infused with elemental energy, providing protection tailored to specific threats. Each elemental variant offers unique defensive properties:

**Air Shield:** Deflects projectiles and neutralizes energy attacks; may also push attackers back.

**Earth Shield:** Forms a solid barrier of rock or crystal, offering extra resistance against physical damage.

**Fire Shield:** Burns away physical attacks, potentially igniting melee attackers.

**Water Shield:** Absorbs impacts, reducing physical and energy damage; may unbalance attackers.

**Energy Shield:** A shimmering barrier that provides ongoing damage reduction, even when active defense is depleted.

**Effect:** Reduces incoming threat points by -1 per die rank (e.g., d4 reduces by 1, d6 by 2).

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

**Maintenance:** Requires concentration, incurring a -1 penalty per die rank to other actions for each additional round.

**Interaction with Physical Shields:** Combine threat reductions from both shields, divide by 2, and round up.

**Elemental Armor (d4 to d12 — Common to Legendary — Protect)**

**Description:** The Elementalist summons Elemental Armor to envelop the target, fortifying them after active defenses are breached. This armor adapts to mitigate various forms of harm based on the chosen element:

**Air Armor:** Enhances agility and evasion; increases movement speed by 10%.

**Earth Armor:** Hardens like rock, absorbing physical damage.

**Fire Armor:** Encases the target in flames; reflects melee damage and grants immunity to non-magical fire.

**Water Armor:** Absorbs impacts; grants partial fire resistance and underwater breathing.

**Energy Armor:** Infuses resilience against physical and magical attacks.

**Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if using d4).

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

**Maintenance:** Requires concentration, with a penalty of -1 per die rank to other actions for each additional round.

**Interaction with Physical Armor:** Use the higher DR between Elemental Armor and physical armor. If Elemental Armor's DR is lower, add +1 per rank of the armor spell to the physical DR.

**Elemental Barrier (d4 to d12—Common to Legendary—Protect):**

**Description:** The Elementalist conjures a Barrier formed from elemental forces, providing tailored defense for groups or strategic battlefield control. Each element adapts to offer unique protective properties:

**Air:** Deflects projectiles, neutralizes energy attacks, and may push attackers back.

**Earth:** Forms a solid wall that absorbs melee and physical damage.

**Fire:** Burns physical attackers, potentially igniting them.

**Water:** Absorbs impacts, disperses blows, and may knock attackers back.

**Energy:** Provides ongoing damage reduction even when active defense is depleted.

**Elemental Walls:** Extend protection to cover groups, providing total or partial cover. Walls impose -4 threat point reductions to ranged attacks passing through them. Crossing through may inflict direct harm based on the element.

**Area and Dimensions:** Base length equals caster’s Ability Branch Maximum Value (MV) × 2 feet, height 5 feet. Shape adjustable at casting, with thickness scaling with Challenge Die (up to 5 feet at d12).

**Modifiers:** Knockback for Air and Water walls; Additional Resistance for Earth and Energy walls to further reduce damage.

Common

**Air Bubble:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self, Creature, or Area] Traps air to allow breathing under water. Creates a small bubble of breathable air around the caster’s or a companion’s head. As the bubble is gas-permeable, this does not block poisons. Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is challenge die d4; +1 added to challenge die per additional creature affected; creating a large breathable bubble is an area effect, adding +4 to challenge die.

**Ball of Light:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area] Creates a ball of light that illuminates an area. The ball of light will bob in the air following the mage or attached to an item. It is not harmful but can light up a large area (up to the ability branch MV ×2 in radius in feet) as if it were a steady lantern. The elementalist can adjust the radius of the light.

**Boil Water:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area] The spell simply heats water to the boiling point. Water vapor is not manipulatable until cooled. Area of effect is up to 2 × basic die rank in height, width, and depth in feet. Creatures standing in affected water suffer no threat points for the first round, but the temperature rises noticeably. Increase by 1 point for every round after that to the MV of the caster’s Competence die rank (1 threat point on 2nd round, 2 on 3rd, etc.). The maintenance penalty is –1 until maximum threat points are reached, then it increases by 1 per round

**Breeze:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area] The caster summons a light breeze in the desired direction that can be used for various purposes. The breeze can be used to whisk away small objects, clear away debris, or disperse smoke or gas. Elementalists can also use magical breezes for misdirection, annoyance, and mischief. 

**Charge of the Elements:** d4—Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster channels energy into himself, temporarily increasing his physical abilities. The caster gains a +1 bonus to any Agility or Strength specialty checks or rolls. Casting Modifiers: increase the challenge die by one step to increase the bonus to +2.

**Cleanse Air:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Area] Remove airborne poisons, smoke, etc. The GM will assign a difficulty based on the air quality. Basic pollen or smog, easy (challenge die d4). Clearing the air in a burning building or room, extreme (challenge die d16). Clearing airborne toxins should always be at least a difficult challenge (challenge die d8). Area cleared equals branch MV radius in feet.

**Crystal Vision:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster gains the ability to see through any crystalline minerals, whether translucent or opaque, up to the ability branch MV in feet, allowing them to see hidden objects or creatures within them. 

**Drown:** Auto—Common—Harm

**Description:** [M / Creature] Slowly increase the amount of water in someone’s lungs. Does no threat points for 2 rounds as the lungs begin to fill, but after that, the spell inflicts 1 threat point per round to passive defense (or a magic active defense if the target has one) until the target perishes or the spell is interrupted.

**Energy Jump:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster channels energy into his or her legs, allowing them to jump a distance up to the ability branch MV in feet. The caster can jump over obstacles or onto higher platforms, but must land on a solid surface. Casting Modifiers: increase the challenge die by +1 for every additional 5 feet in jump distance

**Energy Pulse:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] Sends out a wave of magical energy in a radius equal to the caster’s ability branch MV ×2. This pulse is specifically designed to interact with mechanical devices within its area of effect. It can activate or disrupt their function at the behest of the caster, rolling against a difficulty of d4 for each device. 

**Extinguish Flames:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [Inst / Area variant] As the name implies, this is the ability to get rid of an existing fire. Flames are snuffed out instantly upon a successful roll. The caster rolls only once, but each flame source gets a separate saving throw based on its size. Candles would be easy (d4) to extinguish; a burning house or area of a forest fire would be extreme (2d12). The area of effect (ability branch MV ×2 radius in feet, doubled for mastery) is approximate and flexible — the caster can choose which flames to affect, so long as the flames are in the line of sight.

**Fire Strike:** d4—Common—Harm

**Description:** [M / Creature] This spell allows the caster to manipulate existing fire to move or attack. The mage can use an existing fire source and alter its form to move like a living thing. The fire requires fuel from a nearby source and can be used to inflict physical harm. Unlike Fire Bolt, Fire Strike is maintainable and allows the caster to get one strike per round. The caster can either use the original dice roll as potential harm or reroll each round to determine the potential harm without an additional ability test. The distance at which the mage can control the fire is his or her basic Competence die rank MV in feet, up to 10 × that with mastery. Casting Modifiers: +4 to challenge die to spread the fire in front of foes, acting as a barrier to block movement. The fire inflicts damage equal to the caster’s ability roll +1. When a target walks through the fire willfully, it does not benefit from active defense, but shields and armor still apply. If a target charges through the fire, it takes half damage, and shields and armor apply as normal.

**Fire Trail:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Area] The caster creates a trail of flames behind him or her as he or she moves, igniting flammable objects in the trail.

**Flame Creature:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature] Creates a critter of flame to do the caster’s bidding. This spell animates a flame creature from an existing flame, so it gets no saving throw to break the spell. The flame creature is non-intelligent but will attack enemy targets autonomously each round, doing caster’s basic Competence die rank fire threat points. Casting Modifiers: +2 to challenge die per extra threat point, up to a maximum of the caster’s Competence rank. (Creature hit points = the caster’s basic Competence MV.) Flame Creature Type: Minor Threat Dice: Melee d4 (Fiery Strikes) + possible bonus from the caster's Competence as per the spell description Hit Points: 4 (2/2) [Regular, Small, Mundane] Damage Reduction: None Saving Throw: d4 Battle Phase: 4 (d6) Notes: A creature of animated flame, bound to the caster's will.

Casting Modifiers: attempting to freeze water fast enough to trap a medium-sized creature is +10 to the challenge die. Failing a Prowess → Agility or Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might roll means the target is stuck, unable to free himself from the frozen surface, halving active defense, or all active defense if unlucky enough to be stuck bodily (50% chance).

**Fresh Air:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell creates fresh, breathable air in the form of a bubble. The air continues to exist once created, and maintenance prevents dissipation. It is useful if one finds oneself suddenly high in the atmosphere or underwater or teleported into a dimensional space with no air. If it is cast in a confined space, it can increase air pressure. Area effect is the ability branch MV ×2 radius in feet.

**Fuel Flames:** d4 (Variable)—Common—Harm

**Illuminating Insight:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster gains the ability to perceive energy flows in the surroundings, as his or her eyes emit a faint blue light.

**Resist Elements:** d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate

**Water Ward:** d4—Common—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The magic-wielder creates a shield of water around a single target, granting a +1 bonus to passive defense for the duration of the spell. The shield can absorb up to the caster’s ability branch MV in harm with maintenance, but once it is depleted, the spell ends.

**Water Whip:** d4—Common—Harm 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster creates a whip-like stream of water that lashes out at a single target. It causes ability branch potential harm +1 and can be blocked with a shield, avoided with active defense, or absorbed by armor.

**Arcane Maelstrom:** d6—Rare—Harm

**Description:** [Inst / Area]: A swirling vortex of raw arcane energy erupts from the caster's fingertips, engulfing all targets within a radius determined by doubling the caster's combined Competence and Expertise MV, plus their Wizardry or Theurgy bonus.

Casting with a mastery die doubles the maelstrom's radius. _Casting Modifier_: with a Great (20+) rank in the Competence → Expertise → Wizardry branch, the caster can unleash an intensified Arcane Maelstrom, bypassing active defense points. This enhanced version costs 5 Spirit Points, requires success on a d12 challenge roll using a mastery die, and consumes 1 additional Spirit Point per target beyond the first.

This spell effect can only convert damage not already blocked or absorbed by other effects. The caster must have sufficient spirit points to convert the damage into temporary hit points.

**Fissure:** d6—Uncommon—Harm 

**Description:** [M / Area variant] Opens a split in the ground, whether stone or soil. The caster must stand upon solid earth or a stone floor to cast this spell.

**Purify Water:** d8—Esoteric—Restore

Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is challenge die d8; +1 per additional creature affected.

**Stone Armor:** d8—Esoteric—Harm, Protect, Modify (3 SP) 

**Description:** [M / Self] Caster surrounds himself or herself in stone armor. It adds armor of d8 and +2 threat points to physical attacks owing to the spiky bits on the armor. The spell must be set in advance and cannot be used as a defensive maneuver.

**Stone Skin:** d8—Esoteric—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster can cover his or her skin with a layer of hardened stone, providing increased protection against physical attacks. The stone skin has an armor rating of d8.

**Water Breathing:** d8—Esoteric—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The magic-wielder grants a target the ability to breathe underwater while the spell is maintained. This safeguard prevents the target from drowning and enables free movement in aquatic settings.

**Whirlpool:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Area] The magic-wielder summons a powerful vortex of water whose swirling current is capable of dragging creatures or objects towards its center. The area of effect is up to 2 × the magic-wielder’s ability branch die rank in height, width, and depth in feet. Targets caught in the whirlpool suffer a –2 penalty to all actions and take damage equal to the caster’s ability test roll per round until they escape or the spell ends. A successful valorous saving throw (Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality or Resilience) is required to escape.

**Whirlwind Prison:** d8 (Variable)—Esoteric— Afflict (SP 1)

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] Creates a powerful whirlwind that traps the target, lifting it off the ground and making it vulnerable to attacks. The swirling winds within the whirlwind batter and disorient the target, causing a stunning effect that leaves it dazed and unable to react to the surroundings properly. The target remains suspended within the whirlwind, making it difficult for it to defend itself or take any actions. Casting Modifiers: +1 to the challenge die per additional target.

Occult

**Aeromancy:** d10 (Variable)—Occult—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature or Object] Allows the caster to control the movement of air currents, bending them to his or her will and using them to move objects or creatures. Movement is in any direction, at the spell ability branch MV in yards per round (see Movement in Chapter 3). The spell can be maintained, and the caster must pay a maintenance penalty of –2 to ability tests while maintaining the spell. Casting Modifiers: self or one creature is challenge die d10; +1 added to challenge die per additional creature or object affected.

**Choking Vacuum:** d10—Occult—Afflict 

**Description:** [M / Creature or Self] The caster creates a suffocating lack of air around a single target, causing it to gasp for breath and suffer ability branch damage. Targets affected by this spell also suffer a penalty to their ability tests and have their initiative reduced by one battle phase. The spell costs 1 spirit point to cast, and an additional 1 spirit point for each additional round the spell is maintained. Casting Modifiers: add +1 to the challenge die for each additional round the spell is maintained.

**Energy Surge:** d10—Occult—Modify (4 SP). 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster channels a surge of otherworldly essence into his or her body, temporarily increasing physical abilities. The caster gains a +4 bonus to any Agility or Strength checks or rolls, also increasing movement speed by 12 feet (4 yards) per round. 

**Ethereal Pulse:** d10—Occult—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] Emitting a pulse of mystical energy in a radius equal to your ability branch MV ×2, this spell specifically targets entities of ethereal or astral nature, such as ghosts. To banish these entities, roll your ability branch die against a challenge die of d10. Affected entities get a Saving Throw to resist, based on their creature category (e.g., Minor, Standard, Exceptional, Legendary).

**Flame Trap:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [M / Creature] Sets a trap in a particular area that will erupt in fire if touched. The flame trap leaves a temporary ward on the surface of the trapped area. The potential victim must roll Competence → Perception against a Formidable challenge (d12) to spot the trap. Threat points inflicted by trap equal the caster’s ability branch MV.

**Liquid Armor:** d10—Occult—Harm, Protect, Modify (4 SP)

**Description:** [M / Special] Armor of clear but fast-moving water surrounds the caster from head to toe like a bodysuit, parting only at the eyes, ears, and mouth to allow clear sight, hearing, and speech. Adds an extra d4 armor die and another +2 DR versus elemental attacks. The caster can also attack with tendrils of water, adding +2 threat points to any melee or water-based magic attacks.

**Stone Golem:** d10—Occult—Afflict, Activate (2 sp)

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster summons a stone golem, a formidable creature standing 9 feet tall. Materializing within the caster's line of sight (up to Competence die MV × 2), this golem boasts stats like 2d8 Threat Dice, 112 Hit Points, and a unique shockwave ability. If struck more than once in a round, the golem releases a shockwave that repels all enemies within a 10-foot radius by 2d6 feet and inflicts that many threat points. Due to its large size and magical nature, summoning the golem incurs a -2 penalty to the ability test, which expending spirit points can offset. After the first round, the golem attempts to break free by rolling its highest Threat Dice (2d8) against the caster's relevant ability branch. 

**Stone Weapon:** d10—Occult—Modify

**Description:** [M / Special] Creates a bladed weapon of diamond-hard stone. The glittering weapon created has +4 threat points. The caster can use any appropriate weapon skill to wield it, and it may be used to attack in the round of creation.

**Whelm:** d10—Occult—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Area] Waves of water surge at opponents while the spell lasts: they disrupt the area and may knock over and stun opponents. Those caught in the waves must roll versus Prowess → Agility, or Fortitude → Strength, to maintain balance. Those who fail fall stunned, losing any move or attack next round.

**Whirlwind:** d10—Occult—Afflict (1 SP) 

**Description:** [M / Creature or Area] The caster creates a powerful whirlwind that can afflict the targets within a 10-ft radius circle with a dizzying, disorienting sensation. Targets affected by this spell suffer a penalty to their ability tests and have their initiative reduced by one battle phase. The spell costs 1 spirit point to cast, and an additional 1 spirit point for each additional round the spell is maintained. Casting Modifiers: +1 per 2 ft increase in radius of area of effect.

**Wind Rush:** d10—Occult—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Area] A massive gust of air that can knock over large objects. A very potent version of the Breeze spell. The area affected is a steadily widening stream from the caster to a circle of basic tier MV in feet. Opponents must make a skillful saving throw (Prowess → Agility → Speed or Reaction) vs. the caster’s ability roll or be knocked over and spend the next round getting up.

Legendary

**Crystal Fortress:** d12—Occult—Protect

**Description:** [M / Area] The caster creates a fortress made of crystal that provides cover and protection for allies. The fortress can be up to the ability branch MV ×2 in feet height, and its length in feet is equal to twice the ability branch MV ×2. The fortress has an armor rating of d12 and can absorb harm directed at those inside it. The fortress lasts until dispelled or destroyed.

**Earth Merge:** d12—Legendary—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Self] Bestows the ability to pass through earth and stone. The caster moves more slowly (half normal movement, no sprinting) and leaves no tunnel. There is some danger of disorientation in large bodies of rock (GM’s call).

**Elemental Form:** d12+2—Legendary—Modify, Harm, Protect (SP 5)

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster transforms into a being of pure elemental energy, choosing one of the four core elements: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The transformation grants the caster unique abilities and resistances based on the chosen element, while imposing limitations on communication and spellcasting. 

**Air Form** grants immunity to all standard physical attacks, but non-physical harm does full damage; the caster can attack with microbursts of air, but their voice becomes a whisper, moan, or howl, making it impossible to cast spells normally. 

**Earth Form** grants +2 threat points to all physical attacks, DR 3 and armor equivalency of d12, and physical attacks deal additional damage, but the spell must be prepared in advance. 

**Energy Form** transforms you into a being of pure, radiant energy. You become immune to standard physical attacks and gain the ability to phase through solid objects. However, you are now vulnerable to attacks that disrupt magical energies, such as those from specific artifacts or spells designed to counter magic. You can unleash blasts of pure energy as a weapon, harming both physical and energy-based defenses. This transformation comes at a cost: your voice is reduced to a series of crackles and pops, making normal speech and spellcasting impossible. You retain a vague humanoid shape formed of crackling energy, but your movements become erratic and unpredictable, influenced by the flow of magical currents in the environment.

**Fire Form** grants immunity to physical attacks and fire damage, but water, air, and concussive attacks do full damage; the caster’s fists of flame deal ability branch +5 threat points, but their voice becomes a crackling or roaring tone, preventing spellcasting. 

**Water Form** grants immunity to non-magical physical attacks, but explosions that bypass shielding deal full damage; the caster can attack with hydraulic fists, but their voice becomes a bubbling rush, and normal spellcasting becomes impossible. The transformation costs a base of 5 Spirit Points; additional Spirit Points may be spent to increase threat points, resistance, or attack potency by +1 for each point spent.

**Energy Blade:** d12—Legendary—Harm 

**Description:** [M/ Self] Creates a bladed weapon of pure visible energy that buzzes faintly. The caster wields this blade of light as if it were a real weapon, using the higher of the Competence → Expertise or Prowess → Melee branches. The weapon can harm creatures or objects. Any non-magical weapon, shield, or armor hit by the energy blade (e.g., if blocking), must make an item saving throw (see GM Section) or be reduced by one step of armor or shield protection or, if a fragile object, totally destroyed. Even if it saves, its attack/defense value is reduced by 2 threat points until repaired.

**Glacial Prison:** d12+2—Legendary)—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Creature] With a surge of frigid energy, the caster encases a target in a solid block of ice, requiring the target to make a valorous saving throw against the caster's ability roll to avoid becoming frozen. If unsuccessful, the target remains immobilized and immune to all damage and effects for rounds equal to the caster's level. At the end of each round, the target may attempt another valorous saving throw to break free and act normally on its next turn. While maintaining this spell, the caster incurs a -5 penalty to all other ability tests not related to spellcasting. The spell carries a base challenge die of d12+2 due to its Legendary potency level and costs 2 spirit points to cast.

**Quicksand:** d12—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area variant] Creates a pool of quicksand, 12 feet in diameter, plus 4 feet deep for every die rank in Competence (i.e. up to 20 ft deep). Those in the area of effect must make a skillful saving throw (Prowess → Agility → Speed or Reaction) to avoid being trapped. Any about to enter the area must make a cognitive saving throw (Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery or Cleverness) to avoid it. 

Creatures trapped by the quicksand begin to sink up to the waist; struggling will not make them sink further. 

Those trapped are immobilized but may use their arms. Trying to pull the victim out requires a Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might roll versus the caster’s spell roll, but such force directly damages the victim, causing threat points equal to the roll to passive defense. Casting Modifiers: +5 to the challenge die to alter the sand’s viscosity, asphyxiating victims by sinking them completely, causing 4 threat points per round until they escape. Those in the pool are expelled without further harm when the spell ends.

**Tidal Surge:** d12—Legendary—Modify, Harm (1 SP)

**Description:** [M / Area] The magic-wielder calls forth a massive surge of water, creating a tidal wave that crashes over a designated area. Targets caught in the wave suffer 4 harm points and are knocked prone, while objects or structures in the area may be destroyed. The tidal wave can sweep away any smaller creatures or objects in its path. The area of effect is up to 2 × the magic-wielder’s basic die rank in height, width, and depth in feet. The spell can only be cast near a large body of water or in an area with a significant amount of water present.

**Wind Riding:** d12 (Variable)—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self or Creature] Allows gliding flight for self, another, or others, at the speed of the caster’s ability branch MV ×2 in mph. Intelligent creatures granted the ability of wind riding can direct their movement out of the caster’s line of sight, so long as the spell is maintained. Unintelligent animals lose the ability upon leaving the caster’s line of sight. Casting Modifiers: none for self, one target creature at d14, or selected creatures in 20-foot diameter area of effect at d20+4.

Sorcery

Offense Spells

**Chaos Assault:** d4-d12—variable-Harm

**Description:** Chaos Assault is the signature offensive spell of sorcerers, embodying the volatile and unpredictable nature of chaos. The spell’s form and damage vary, reflecting different aspects of chaos, void, and shadows. The caster selects one manifestation upon casting. Manifestations include:

**Flux:** A chaotic blend of colors, warping space around it as it streaks towards its target.

**Void:** A dark sphere of nothingness that erodes anything it touches.

**Shadow:** A shadowy tendril, chilling the air as it strikes.

**Mind:** A wave of disruptive psychic energy assaulting the target's senses.

**Phantasm:** Conjures nightmarish illusions, causing fear or hallucinations.

This spell can be modified and enhanced using the following options:

**Range and Dimensions**

**Maximum Range:** Calculated as (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the range is doubled.

**Sorcerous Bolt:** Appears as a 1-foot diameter mass targeting a single enemy.

**Sorcerous Stream:** Forms a beam of similar width and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Sorcerous Burst:** Creates an area effect with a radius equal to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry bonuses in feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect when utilized.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on

**Stream (Challenge d6):** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires an ongoing maintenance penalty of –1 per additional round. Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

**Burst (Challenge d8/d10):** Converts the spell to affect an area, increasing the Challenge Die. At d8, it creates an area-of-effect explosion affecting multiple enemies. At d10, it becomes an enhanced area explosion with increased radius and damage.

Afflictions: Sorcerers can add one affliction to the attack, which immediately affects the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and costs additional Spirit Points.

**Afflictions**

**Temporal Disruption (Challenge d4):** This affliction manifests as a distortion in time around the target, causing them to experience brief lapses in perception and reaction. The effect reduces their initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one full step, e.g., from d10 to d8). Increase the difficulty of the sorcerer's test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced accordingly. This affliction typically lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

**Shadow Knock (Challenge d6):** This effect appears as a shadowy force sweeping the target off their feet or a tendril of darkness pushing against them. The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back. Knockback distance is determined by the caster's Willpower die rank in feet. A successful save avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the target ends within another creature's reach.

**Mind Stun (Challenge d8):** The stunning effect is caused by a wave of psychic energy short-circuiting the target's senses or a burst of chaotic energy overwhelming them. The target may not move or attack for one full round and is considered temporarily incapacitated. This stun effect typically lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

**Sensory Overload (Challenge d10):** This affliction severely compromises or overloads a target's sensory perception through nightmarish illusions or chaotic energy. Most Competence → Perception checks using the affected sense automatically fail, with a possible –5 penalty for compensation attempts. Attacks by affected characters suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability, this often results in minimal or no threat points. Effects typically last one round unless specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Sorcerers use a universal Eldritch Defense spell, customized to fit their sorcerous path, offering either Sorcerous Shielding or Sorcerous Armor. The spell's potency scales with the caster's proficiency, determined by the Challenge Die rank selected during casting.

**Sorcerous Shielding:** (d4 to d12)—Common—Protect

**Description:** The caster creates a swirling shield of dark energy or chaotic sorcerous power that envelops the target, reducing threat points from incoming attacks. This shield manifests as a semi-transparent energy field, often appearing as dark tendrils or shimmering distortions that warp reality around the target.

**Shielding Effect:** Reduces incoming threat points by an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2, and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

**Maintenance:** The caster may maintain the shield, but incurs a cumulative -1 penalty to other actions for each additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Sorcerous Armor:** (d4 to d12)—Common—Protect

**Description:** The caster weaves a layer of magical protection around the target, enhancing their resilience against harm. This Sorcerous Armor appears as an invisible barrier or a subtle shimmer that molds to the target's form, acting as an additional layer of defense.

**Armor Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the target’s active defense is depleted.

**Maintenance:** Maintaining this magical armor requires concentration, with the caster incurring a -1 penalty to other actions per additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Versatility of Sorcerous Defense:** Sorcerers wield Eldritch Defense to adapt to threats, whether by adding layers of magical armor or conjuring shields of dark energy.

Common

**Arcane Lock:** d4—Common—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Object] The caster imbues an object with an arcane lock, making it more difficult to open or break into by one challenge die level. Locks, boxes, and so on are rated d4 to d12 for security (increasing to d14, d16, d18, d20 as needed). Casting Modifiers: +2 per additional challenge die level added.

**Arcane Mark:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] The caster imbues an object with an arcane mark, allowing him or her to locate it from a distance. The mark lasts for one week per caster level or until dispelled. The caster can concentrate on it for a few minutes to get a direction and distance for the object, if within 10 miles per caster level. Casting Modifiers: +1 per extra week’s duration.

**Minor Illusion:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] Creates a simple visual illusion of an object. It looks like an object is there when it isn’t. The object must be small, less than a cubic foot, and easy to describe.

**Olfactory Illusion:** d4—Common—Activate.

**Description:** [Inst / Object] Creates a simple olfactory illusion of a smell. It smells like whatever the caster chooses, within the scope of his or her own experience. Musty, rot, skunk, dry wood, paper, textiles, vegetation, smoke, incense and perfumes, salty air, fresh blood, guano, offal, or rotting meat, to list a few ideas

**Shadow Step:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster can shadowstep short distances by moving rapidly between shadows. This can be used to get past obstacles or escape danger quickly. The distance the caster can shadowstep is determined by his or her basic Competence die rank × 5 feet. Casting Modifiers: +1 per 5 feet increase.

**Teleport Object:** d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] Translocates an item from place to place. The target object is teleported a short distance, up to 10 × basic tier MV in feet within line of sight. The object’s size determines the challenge die: d4 for minuscule to d12+2 for gargantuan. (For size ranges and challenge dice, see the Object Summoning Difficulty table page 244). 

**Transmute Rock:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] The caster can temporarily transmute a small amount of rock or stone (about half a brick per level) into a different substance, such as mud or sand. Casting Modifiers: +1 per additional ‘half brick’ volume transmuted.

Uncommon

**Audio Illusion:** d6—Uncommon—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster manipulates illusionary sound. The creature the spell targets perceives a caster-specified object as the sound source. The sound can be anything the caster wishes and can be soft or loud, but not painfully loud. If someone who suspects the sound isn’t real makes a successful Competence → Perception roll, he or she will know it is illusory.

**Chameleon:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] This spell lets the caster blend in with the surroundings, but he or she cannot move. People not specifically looking for someone are unlikely to notice anything unusual. Perception rolls used to detect the caster are at –3. 

**Dustify:** d6—Uncommon—Destroy 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] The caster channels destructive energy towards an object, causing it to disintegrate into dust. The size of the object that can be affected by this spell increases with the caster’s level: a maximum of 1 cubic foot or 100 pounds weight per level, whichever is less. The spell cannot target a living creature

**Enfeeblement:** d6—Uncommon—Modify 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The caster weakens the target’s physical abilities, reducing its Strength and Agility by 2 points for each level of the caster (this may result in a negative score when trying to use the abilities while the spell is maintained). Casting modifier: +1 per extra target within range.

**Flux Portal:** d6—Uncommon—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self, Creature] The caster creates a temporary portal to another location. The portal can transport the caster and a single ally or item with a weight of up to ability branch MV × 20 pounds. The portal can be used once before dissipating, but the caster can choose to maintain concentration to keep the portal open longer

**Illusory Disguise:** d6—Uncommon—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster can fully change the appearance of a recipient, including clothing, to make him or her look like a specific individual. The illusion is visual only; voice and scent are not altered in any way. If someone who suspects the impersonation makes a successful Competence → Perception roll, he or she will see through the illusion.

**Phantom Blade:** d6—Uncommon—Harm 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The caster creates a magical blade made of pure energy that can be wielded as a weapon, and can be used to strike from a distance. The blade inflicts harm equal to the ability branch. The blade is visible but can pass through solid objects, making it an ideal weapon for surprise attacks

**Summon Monster:** d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Special] The sorcerer summons a humanoid monster to beset his foes, shaping its visage within his imagination and bringing it forth from the magical weave. The chosen challenge die rank determines both monster hit points (using MV) and potential harm. The sorcerer chooses the die type (d4 or d6 for a rank and file creature, d8 to d12 for a stronger one) and number of dice (1 for a minor creature, 2 for a standard one). For example, to summon a strong standard 2d12 creature, the caster must succeed in a roll versus 2d12. If the spell is maintained beyond the first encounter, the monster gets to roll a save vs. Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance, and disappears if the save is successful.

Esoteric

**Apport Object:** d8—Esoteric—Activate 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] With this spell the caster can apport (materialize) an object attuned to him within line of sight. The attuned object can weigh up to 2500 lb, e.g., as large as a 3 ft boulder, a horse, or a wagon, and may be as far away as ability branch MV × 10 miles when apported. Attunement requires that the caster have daily contact with an object for one month, and inscribe it with his or her personal sigil. Casting Modifiers: If the caster wants to drop something out of the sky on an enemy, add +2 to the challenge die per 10 feet above the target that the object appears

**Cone of Silence:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area] The caster creates an area of silence that sound cannot penetrate. The affected area is a cone-shaped space with a base diameter equal to the caster’s ability branch MV × 6 inches and a height equal to the base diameter. Sounds cannot pass from the inside to the outside of the area or vice versa. Those within the cone can hear one another if they are in direct contact, but sounds do not travel through the air. The cone is usually oriented with its point upwards. The spell can be used for privacy or for offensive purposes. If used offensively, targets must make a _valorous_ save to resist its effects

**Full Body Illusion:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] Completely alter one’s appearance to look like another living creature. Can fully change appearance, including clothing, voice, and scent, into something else entirely. This is only an illusion and grants none of the powers of the creature imitated. It can be used to mimic specific individuals. If someone who suspects the impersonation makes a successful Competence → Perception roll, he or she will see through the illusion.

**Illusory Quiescence:** d8—Esoteric—Activate 

Description [M / Self]: Through this power, the caster can appear motionless, as if standing still and pondering something, or merely speaking, while enacting some complex movement, usually activating a spell, or perhaps using a missile weapon or palming something. The effect persists for one round of time: anything that takes longer will be noticed. Note that this power’s effect can also be broken by a suspicious (e.g. attacked) character making a successful Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance roll

**Minion Horde:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Creature]: Summons a horde of humanoid minions to attack an enemy. The number of creatures summoned is equal to the result of the ability check, and each creature has 1 threat point, 1 hit point, and 0 active defense. The creatures’ group prowess rank (inititiave) is equal to the caster’s specialty die. The spell operates much like a regular area effect Harm spell, with the horde attacking as many targets as it can surround, but unlike such a spell, threat points are divided among those trapped by the summoned attackers. Such swarms are always instinct-driven, and while able to follow simple commands, never possess real intelligence or significant equipment. The caster can cast other spells while directing the horde. The normal maintenance penalty applies.

**Object Space:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Special] Ability to access an extra dimensional area for holding items. The size of the space accessed is the Competence MV in cubic feet. Objects in the sub-dimension will remain there until removed, and do not age, rot, or deteriorate. If the spell is not maintained, the item is inaccessible until the spell is recast. The space is incompatible with living matter, so any attempt to teleport creatures into it will fizzle. (A sorcerer could open another’s object space by extracting the attunement knowledge with a spell and then using this spell at double the challenge die.)

**Phantasms:** d8—Esoteric—Harm

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster draws forth an apparition of the target’s worst nightmares from his mind, causing psychic damage. This is non-lethal preternatural harm: it cannot be blocked or parried by normal shields or swords, and subdues the target but does not kill. This spell drains spirit points, then passive defense after. A victim brought to zero passive defense in this manner is incapacitated until brought above zero. The victim must then make a Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance saving throw versus the attack roll or remain unconscious for another 1d4 rounds. The spell is maintainable, even if the victim leaves the sight of the original caster, inflicting the same amount of damage each round until the victim makes a successful saving throw to break free of the apparition.

**Transdimensional Shift:** d8 (Variable)—Esoteric—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self, Object] The user activates a brief portal to another realm, enabling instant travel between two locations. The challenge die dictates the maximum distance, ranging from d4 (short) to d8 (long). The shift accommodates the user and an object weighing up to ability branch MV × 20 pounds. The portal remains active for a single use but can be sustained longer through concentration. Casting Modifiers: Scaling; Starting at d8, each die rank increase allows the transport of one additional creature or object. If cast with a d4, the user can only transport themselves but gains a +2 bonus on the next physical or mental ability test.

Occult

**Dimensional Travel:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Area special] This spell allows the caster and other willing creatures to travel to and through other dimensions or planes of existence. Other beneficial spells must be prepared if that plane features an inhospitable environment. The location arrived at is an exact location outlined in the complex verbalizing of the spell. It must have been visited before or studied extensively in books and accurately envisioned. All willing creatures in the area of effect (MV × 5 feet radius) are dimensionally shifted, along with any visible objects willed by the caster within the area of effect up to 300 lbs. Other dimensions or planes can be any fantastical place the GM allows in the campaign. Shifting to a place inaccurately envisioned may result in going astray by 2d6 miles outside, 2d6 rooms inside. 

**Havoc:** d10—Occult—Modify

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell invokes and unleashes the dangerous and disorienting effects of chaos in a designated area. The caster meditates on the philosophical principle of unreality in the universe, channeling chaotic energy to play havoc with ordered reality in the affected area. A successful roll imposes a –4 penalty to saves versus any magical effects, to one’s ability to see through illusions, and to attempts to cast spells that tend to increase order (such as control, healing, or information spells). Those in the area can attempt a Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience save to throw off the effects.

**Mirrored Opponent:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Special] The caster, by mental command, activates an illusion affecting a target observing his own reflection in a mirror. An illusionary mirrored likeness steps from the mirror and attacks the target. This effect generates non-physical threat points, reducing the victim’s passive defense, no matter if active defense is attempted! The character will be duped by the spell until a successful saving throw is made (allowed once per round versus the illusory source of magic, not per attack). Luckily, illusion threat points are non-lethal, meaning that although such an attack can knock out an opponent, it cannot reduce Fortitude below zero. Others observing the victim being attacked by his apparent double may notice the mirror reversal.

**Teleport Self:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Self] Translocate oneself, including any objects on one’s person. Distance traveled by the caster, and all worn or carried, is up to 10 × basic tier MV in feet within line of sight. 

The sorcerer can attempt to use teleportation defensively. If an enemy’s attack fails to penetrate the caster’s active defense, the caster can make a challenge roll versus the challenge die of the spell and the attacker’s roll. If both are successful, the teleport activates, and the magic-wielder escapes close engagement or a vulnerable location with no opportune attack allowed. If the enemy’s attack penetrates, this maneuver will not work.

**Waking Terror:** d10—Occult—Afflict

**Description:** [Inst / Special] The target suffers overwhelming, paralyzing terror. The target is stunned and loses access to any active defense, but can still use innate powers or cast spells with no words or gestures. A victim must make a Fortitude → Willpower roll each time to attack or focus on anything other than the waking terror brought to its mind by the spell. In addition to the initial saving throw, the victim can attempt each round to break the illusion with a Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience roll.

**Whisper of Woe:** d10—Uncommon—Afflict, Mental

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster whispers a mournful chant, filling the air with a palpable sense of dread. The target feels their mental strength wane, their resolve crumbling under the weight of unseen burdens. This saps the target's mental fortitude, overwhelming them with despair and reducing their will to fight. The primary effect of the spell is to reduce the target's Willpower by one die rank for one round. This reduction decreases the target's Spirit Points, making them more susceptible to fear, mental influence, and skill checks requiring willpower. The secondary effect is a -2 penalty on all Willpower-based skill checks. Maintenance: -3

Legendary

**Apport Creature:** d12—Legendary—Afflict

Description [Inst / Creature]: With this spell the caster can apport (materialize) a creature attuned to him within line of sight. The attuned creature may be as far away as ability branch MV × 10 miles when apported. To attune it, the caster must (usually with the aid of skill in Arcanum) bind the creature to him via an already attuned item, such as magical shackles, an irremovable bracelet, or an embedded gem. Item attunement requires that the caster have daily contact with the item for one month, and inscribe it with his 

or her personal sigil. Binding is easy with a tamed animal such as a horse. Control of monsters and so on must be established by other means. 

Casting Modifiers: If the caster wants to drop the creature out of the sky on an enemy, add +2 to the 

challenge die per 10 feet above the target that the creature appears. This immediately allows the upset creature a Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance roll to break the attunement. Apporting a creature larger than a horse requires a larger challenge of 2d12 (elephant-sized) or 3d12 (dragon-sized)

**Assume Inanimate Form:** d12—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [M / Creature]: This spell makes the recipient look like an inanimate object: a chair, table, pillar, chest, barrel, rug, etc., as desired. The illusion only fools visual searches; scent and touch are not affected. Perception can be used to detect those hidden by this illusion, but people not specifically looking for someone are unlikely to notice anything unusual.

**Dreamscape:** d12—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Creature] Creates a fully immersive illusion for a victim. This is the big boy of the illusion category. The victim only experiences what the caster wishes, and believes what he sees, feels, and hears. This can be a simple scenario where the victim thinks everything, including that cliff, is 5 feet to the left, or he can be led to believe he is at the gates of hell. It is resisted by a Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience roll.

**Mass Invisibility:** d12—Legendary—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Area] Mass Invisibility allows the caster to conceal several selected targets within a selected area, even while they are moving. The spell’s range is calculated as caster’s Competence → Expertise MV × 4 (doubled if activated with a mastery die), and its area of effect is a circle of radius Competence → Expertise MV × 2 + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus. While the spell does not hide sound, smell, or touch, Perception checks for Mass Invisibility recipients are at a –5 penalty. Attackers must pass a Perception check (at –5) to attack at –5; otherwise, they strike randomly at –12.

THAUMATURGY

Offensive Spells

Thaumaturgy represents a methodical and scholarly approach to magic, focusing on the precise manipulation of arcane energies. 

**Arcane Assault:** d4-d12—Variable—Harm

**Description:** Thaumaturges use Arcane Bolt as their primary offensive spell, which can be imbued with various magical properties reflecting different aspects of arcane study. These manifestations include

**Force:** A pure expression of magical energy, impacting targets with raw power.

**Transmutation:** Alters the physical properties of the target.

**Abjuration:** Disrupts other magical effects surrounding the target.

**Divination:** Reveals hidden truths or weaknesses in the target.

**Range and Dimensions**

**Maximum Range:** Calculated as (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the range is doubled.

**Arcane Bolt:** A 1-foot diameter bolt targeting a single enemy.

**Arcane Stream:** A continuous beam with a width of 2 feet and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Arcane Burst:** An area effect with a radius of (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry bonuses in feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect when utilized.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

**Stream (Challenge d6):** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires an ongoing maintenance penalty of –1 per additional round. Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

**Burst (Challenge d8/d10):** Converts the spell to affect an area, increasing the Challenge Die. At d8, it creates an area-of-effect explosion affecting multiple enemies. At d10, it becomes an enhanced area explosion with increased radius and damage.

**Afflictions**

Thaumaturges can add one affliction to the attack, which immediately affects the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and costs additional Spirit Points.

**Afflictions Breakdown**

**Arcane Impediment (Challenge d4):** This affliction slows the target by interfering with the flow of magical energy around them. The effect reduces their initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one full step, e.g., from d10 to d8). Increase the difficulty of the thaumaturge's test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced accordingly. This affliction typically lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

**Arcane Displacement (Challenge d6):** Uses precise magical force to knock targets prone or push them back. The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back. Knockback distance is determined by the caster's Willpower die rank in feet. A successful save avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the target ends within another creature's reach.

**Arcane Disruption (Challenge d8):** Temporarily severs the target's connection to magical energies, stunning them. The target may not move or attack for one full round and is considered temporarily incapacitated. This stun effect typically lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

**Arcane Overload (Challenge d10):** Overwhelms the target's senses with an excess of magical information, severely compromising their perception and actions. Most Competence → Perception checks using the affected sense automatically fail, with a possible –5 penalty for compensation attempts. Attacks by affected characters suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. For those with a d4 in the relevant ability, this often results in minimal or no threat points. Effects typically last one round unless specified otherwise.

Defense Spells

Thaumaturges build their defense spells from Eldritch Armor and Eldritch Shield, offering two primary forms of protection: Arcane Shielding and Arcane Armor. The spell's potency scales with the caster's proficiency, determined by the Challenge Die rank selected during casting.

**Arcane Shielding (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

**Description:** The caster creates a swirling shield of dark energy or chaotic thaumaturgic power that envelops the target, reducing threat points from incoming attacks. This shield manifests as a semi-transparent energy field, often appearing as dark tendrils or shimmering distortions that warp reality around the target.

**Shielding Effect:** Reduces incoming threat points by an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2, and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

**Maintenance:** The caster may maintain the shield, but incurs a cumulative –1 penalty to other actions for each additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Arcane Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

**Description:** The caster weaves a layer of magical protection around the target, enhancing their resilience against harm. This Arcane Armor appears as an invisible barrier or a subtle shimmer that molds to the target's form, acting as an additional layer of defense.

**Armor Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the target’s active defense is depleted.

**Maintenance:** Maintaining this magical armor requires concentration, with the caster incurring a –1 penalty to other actions per additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Arcane Walls**

Thaumaturges can extend their protective magic to create Arcane Walls, providing cover and strategic advantages on the battlefield.

**Dimensions**

**Length:** Equal to the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV × 2 in feet.

**Height:** Standard height of 5 feet, adjustable based on the caster's intent.

**Thickness:** Increases with the Challenge Die, from 1 foot at d4 up to 5 feet at d12.

**Effects**

**Cover:** Provides total or partial cover, granting bonuses to defense against ranged attacks.

**Threat Reduction:** Imposes a –4 Threat Point reduction to attacks passing through the wall due to its protective interference.

**Transparency:** The Arcane Wall can be opaque or translucent, at the caster's discretion, affecting visibility.

**Modifiers**

**Reflective Surface:** By increasing the SP Cost by 1, the wall can reflect a portion of magical attacks back at the attacker.

**Enhanced Resistance:** Additional SP can be spent to increase the wall’s resistance to specific types of damage (e.g., physical, elemental).

**Versatility and Adaptation**

Thaumaturges excel at manipulating their Arcane Barrier to suit various situations.

**Shape Manipulation:** The barrier or wall can be shaped into angles, arcs, or even domes, offering flexibility in protection.

**Selective Protection:** The caster can designate which creatures are protected or hindered by the barrier.

**Limitations**

**Concentration:** Sustaining complex barriers requires significant focus, limiting the caster's ability to perform other strenuous actions.

**Energy Demand:** High-level barriers consume more Spirit Points and may quickly deplete the caster's reserves if used excessively.

**Practical Applications**

**Battlefield Control:** Use Arcane Walls to funnel enemies or protect flanks.

**Team Protection:** Shield allies during retreats or when preparing powerful attacks.

**Environmental Adaptation:** Create barriers to block environmental hazards, such as fire or toxic gas.

Common

**Banish:** d4—Common—Afflict 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] Banish a summoned creature. Banishment requires meeting or exceeding the challenge die needed to summon the targeted creature (the GM should know this but keep it secret). Success means the summoning is broken, and the creature will vanish. Even a failed attempt to banish a summoned creature allows it an immediate saving throw to break free of the original summoner’s command. All casters know when a summoned creature under their command is subject to an attempt to banish it.

**Claw Growth:** d4—Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Creature] Claw Growth imbues the recipient's unarmed strikes with arcane potency. These enchanted claws receive a +1 bonus to threat points but still interact with armor in the usual way. Unlike typical unarmed attacks, these arcane-imbued strikes don't suffer extra damage from parries, making them as viable as wielding a mundane weapon..

**Conjure Weapon:** d4 —Common—Activate.

**Description:** [M / Special] Conjure Weapon enables the caster to materialize a basic weapon from a mystical armory, which most thaumaturges prepare in advance. The conjured weapon conforms to the standard statistics of its type. A roll exceeding 4 ensures the weapon's immediate readiness for the recipient; otherwise, readying the weapon takes one round. The weapon stays in existence as long as the caster maintains the spell, returning to the mystical armory upon spell completion.

**Echo:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object, Self] The caster imbues an object or himself or herself with a faint echo of his or her presence, causing the spell target to resonate with magic. Any spell cast on the object or the caster within the next hour gains a +1 bonus to its casting roll. This spell cannot be cast on a spell already imbued with Echo. Note: This spell can be used to enhance the effectiveness of other spells, making them more likely to succeed.

**Fortify Object:** d4 —Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] Activate this spell to augment an object's resilience, making it tougher to break or destroy. The spell increases the object's structural hit points based on the caster's roll and the object's initial structural HP as specified in the Table—General Categories of Size and Weights (see page 251). To determine the spell's effect, add the caster's roll to the object's existing structural HP. For example, a d4 roll of 3 will add 3 structural hit points to the object. For objects crafted from especially robust materials, double the caster's roll before adding it to the object's structural HP.The effect endures as long as the caster maintains the spell. Once the spell concludes, the object reverts to its original structural hit points..

**Lighten:** d4 —Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Object] Reduces the weight of an object or individual. The object must be person-sized or less. The maintenance penalty is –1 to reduce weight to a half, –3 to reduce weight to a quarter, and –5 to make the object or person weightless

**Magic Ride:** d4—Common—Activate

**Description:** [M / Object]: Can add the power of flight to an object. Objects can be ridden if the spell is maintained: carpets and brooms seem especially popular. Movement rate is the caster’s sprinting speed (see Combat, Movement).

**Mend:** d4 (Variable)— Common—Restore 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] This spell effects instant repair of an object, if most or all parts of it are present. It will not restore missing parts. The GM sets the challenge based on the state of the object: from snapped in half, easy (d4), to crushed to bits, extreme (2d12)

**Savorless:** d4—Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Creature] Disrupts senses of taste and smell. The affected creature cannot roll for Perception with these senses (at GM’s discretion, it can compensate for the loss, e.g., a dog tracking by sight, not scent, may allow a roll with a –12 penalty). The save against the spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

**Sharpen Blade:** d4—Common—Restore 

**Description [Inst / Object]:** A specific repair spell for maintaining weapons, restoring them to a quality like new. Edges are sharpened, bends and rust are removed. It cannot restore completely missing chunks, but even a badly damaged weapon will become serviceable.

**Weaken Creature:** d4 (Variable)—Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster weakens the target creature’s muscles, lowering its potential harm and physical prowess. The weakened creature has its ability tests and threat points for any physical attack or feat of strength lowered by 1 per the caster’s chosen challenge die rank: –1 penalty at d4 to –5 at d12.

**Weaken Object:** d4—Common—Modify

**Description:** [M / Creature] Use this spell to reduce an object's durability, making it more susceptible to breakage. The spell decreases the object's structural hit points based on the caster's roll and the object's initial structural HP as indicated in the Table—General Categories of Size and Weights (see page 251). Subtract the caster's roll from the object's existing structural hit points to find the new, reduced structural HP. For instance, a d4 roll of 3 will remove 3 structural hit points from the object. Objects that reach zero structural hit points must pass a saving throw based on their material type (Steel 3d12, Bronze 3d10, Iron 2d12, Stone 2d10, Brick 2d8, Wood 2d6) or they will disintegrate. As an option, the caster can ritualize this spell and combine it with a permanency effect to make the weakening last indefinitely.

Uncommon

**Contingent Notification:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [Special / Self] Using this power, the caster is alerted whenever a previously prepared time-based power is activated. The notification is heard as a distant chime (or similar) in the caster’s mind. This power must be activated immediately after the power it is to monitor. Its duration is the same as the previously activated power since it augments that power. The associated ward-maintained spell, or triggering condition, is usually cast as a ritual to maximize the duration of this spell.

**Create Illusion:** d6—Uncommon—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature or Object] The caster creates a realistic illusion of a creature or object. The illusion can be used to distract enemies or hide a valuable object. 

**Dimensional Pocket:** d6—Uncommon— Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self, Object] The caster creates a small pocket dimension within an object, allowing it to store items without taking up physical space. The pocket can hold up to 10 cubic feet of material and can only be accessed by the caster. The spell lasts for up to 1 day before the pocket dimension collapses (instantly expelling the pocketed items)

**Forced Egress:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Area] The spell allows instant travel outdoors, opening a portal directly outside the nearest exit from the caster’s current whereabouts. After stepping through the portal, he and others who walk through it will find themselves at the nearest exit threshold on the side that isn’t barred or blocked

**Invisibility:** d6—Uncommon—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster cloaks the target creature in a veil of invisibility, rendering them invisible to the naked eye. The spell is broken if the target attacks or performs any other aggressive action.

**Mana Burst:** d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Harm 

**Description:** [Inst / Area] The caster channels a burst of crackling energy into the surrounding area, harming all creatures in the area of effect. The spell inflicts ability branch potential harm +2. Threat points can be blocked with a shield, avoided with active defense, or absorbed by armor. Casting Modifiers: +1 per additional threat point.

**Phantom Steed:** d6—Uncommon— Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature] Conjure an ethereal steed for quick and unworldly transport. The steed moves at a speed of 50 ft per round and can bear either the caster or an ally. The steed can phase through solid objects, but naturally, this ability doesn't extend to the rider. Casting Modifier: Roll an additional d8 against the ability test or expend 4 spirit points. Success permits both steed and rider to pass safely through a solid object; failure results in an abrupt halt and ejection of the rider before the object is traversed.

**Quickened Reflexes**

**Rank:** d6—Uncommon—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature]: This spell enhances the target's reaction speed, granting them a temporary boost to their initiative for a single battle phase. The bonus to initiative is determined by the challenge die, with a d4 providing a +1 bonus, a d6 providing a +2 bonus, and so on, up to a d12 providing a +5 bonus. This bonus is added to the target's Prowess Score maximum value, potentially allowing them to act earlier in the battle phase.

**Strengthen Creature:** d6 (Variable)—Uncommon—Modify.

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster strengthens the target creature’s muscles, raising its physical prowess and potential harm in attacks. The strengthened creature has its ability tests and threat points for any physical attack or feat of strength raised by 1 per the caster’s chosen challenge die rank: +1 at d4 to +5 at d12

**Weapon Readiness:** d6—Uncommon—Activate. 

**Description:** [Inst / Object] The caster makes the weapon held by the target better attuned to the wielder. This spell grants a +2 initiative bonus to the target weapon, even if the wielder does not normally benefit from weapon bonuses (i.e. if not specialized in Melee)

Esoteric 

**Dance of Blades:** d8—Esoteric—Harm 

**Description:** [M / Area] Animate and direct weapons within a designated area (radius determined by 2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus). Initially, the spell controls a single weapon. However, a successful mastery die roll increases the number of weapons manipulated to your ability branch's MV. Directed weapons can engage enemies autonomously, with each doing d4 threat points of damage individually. When focusing the spell's energy on a single blade, the threat points rise to d8. Should the caster have the Ferocity focus, that bonus adds to the threat points.

**Elemental Transmutation:** d8— Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] Transform a non-living object into a different elemental state—lead to gold, wood to crystal, etc. The object's pre-transmutation value must not exceed the caster's ability branch MV in silver pieces ($10 per coin). Once cast, the transmutation becomes permanent unless the caster reverses it or someone dispels it.

**Illusionary Clone:** d8—Esoteric—Protect 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster creates an illusionary clone, which appears to be an identical copy of the caster. The clone has no physical presence and cannot interact with the environment, but can be used as a decoy to distract enemies. The clone lasts for up to 1 minute or until dispelled or the caster stops maintaining the spell.

**Levitation:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster causes the target to levitate up to 10 feet above the ground and remain in mid-air. The target can move in any direction, but cannot exceed the maximum height. The target cannot take any other actions while levitating, and the spell lasts for up to 1 minute

**Manipulate Object:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] The caster can cause a mechanical thing to operate independently of a person, affecting medium-sized things up to 300 lbs. This can cause a water wheel to start spinning, a door to unlock, a chest lid to open, etc. The object targeted operates as if manipulated by hand, unless too complex for intuitive activation or use. Such use may spring a trapped object or activate a contingent spell

**Spatial Warp:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] The caster manipulates the fabric of space around an object, causing it to teleport to a new location within the caster's line of sight and a range up to the caster's ability level multiplied by 10 in feet. The object must weigh less than or equal to the caster's ability level multiplied by 5 pounds and cannot be living or attached to a living creature. If the object belongs to another person, that person may make a Fortitude save, using Willpower and Resistance as key abilities, to prevent the effect.

**Transmute Flesh:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster transforms the target’s flesh into a different substance, such as stone or metal. The target’s physical appearance changes to reflect the new substance, and they gain resistance to physical harm. However, it also loses mobility and may suffer other negative effects at the GM’s discretion. The target may make a Fortitude save to resist the effect.

Occult

**Deafness:** d10—Occult—Afflict 

**Description:** [M / Creature] Disrupts the sense of hearing. Perception checks by the affected creature using hearing automatically fail (at GM’s discretion, it can compensate for the loss, e.g., lip reading may allow a roll with a –12 penalty). The save against the spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

**Discordance:** d10—Occult—Afflict 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature]: A bolt of chaotic force swirls outward to envelop the target, causing a lack of harmony between mind and body, resulting in severe disorientation and severely slowed actions. The target takes its next action last in the round (battle phase 5, initiative 1). The save against the spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

**Loop ime:** d10—Occult—Afflict 

**Description:** [M / Creature]: The caster warps time, forcing the target to repeat the last action taken. If the last action was an attack, and nobody is still in the exact spot where it was made, it’s an automatic waste of effort. Likewise, if the target’s last action was to drink a potion, but that potion is used up, he is forced to repeat the action without the benefit. Other consequences are at the discretion of the GM. The afflicted may make a saving throw each round that the status effect is maintained, and success ends the condition.

**Matter Fusion:** d10—Occult -Modify 

**Description:** [M / Object] This spell allows the caster to fuse the physical properties of two chosen objects into a single, new entity with combined features. For example, fusing two swords could result in a double-edged weapon that embodies the traits of both original swords. The caster may maintain the fusion for an indefinite period, or opt to reverse it with a subsequent casting. Both the concentration required and the risk of adverse outcomes remain high.Limits on size and weight of the objects depend on the caster’s level, ranging from Miniscule objects at Level 1 to Large objects at Level 5, as outlined in the General Categories of Size and Weights table (see page 251).

**Monster Form:** d10—Occult—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster takes on a fully monstrous form. The creature has a shield DR value of 1, d4 armor, and +1 to potential harm and Perception rolls. The caster may use the monstrous form to cause harm, including a ranged attack (player’s choice as to form of the attack). Threat points are Competence → Expertise branch +1, and range is 10 × basic tier MV feet.

**Temporal Rift:** d10—Occult—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Area] With this spell, the caster opens a rift in the fabric of time within a designated area. Affected creatures must pass a Fortitude save, guided by Willpower and Resilience, or experience a temporal distortion. Their actions either accelerate or decelerate by ±3 to initiative, impacting the time required to complete tasks, initiative rolls, or battle phases. The rift's duration equals the number of rounds determined by the caster's Competence → Expertise ability branch. After the spell's duration ends, time within the affected area resumes its regular flow.

Legendary

**Alter Age:** d12+2—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [Inst / Creature]: The caster temporarily makes the target much younger or older at a dizzying and terrifying rate. The accelerated aging or rejuvenation is painful and disorienting due to its suddenness. The target's skin wrinkles or smooths, hair turns white or returns to its youthful color, and their body shrinks or grows to reflect the age alteration. Clothes and equipment adjust magically to fit the target's transformed form. The effects of the spell are temporary and last for 2 rounds. At the end of the duration (round 2), the target reverts to their original age, experiencing the same disorientation and physical adjustments in reverse.

**Blindness:** d12—Legendary—Afflict 

**Description:** [M / Creature] Disrupts the sense of sight. Perception checks by the affected creature using sight automatically fail (at GM’s discretion, it can compensate for the loss, e.g., relying on hearing may allow a roll with a –12 penalty). The save against the spell is Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance.

**Demolish:** d12—Legendary—Modify

**Description:** [Inst / Object] The caster focuses on destroying non-living matter, causing it to break apart, crumble, or dissolve. The caster can attempt to destroy an object up to 100 lbs. in weight. The object must be contained wholly within an area equaling the ability branch maximum in feet for length and height. The object can be a door, gate, or other object standing alone. It works on solid earth or rock (affecting about a cubic foot). This unusual spell supersedes the rules for magically lowering object durability.

**Initiative Warp:** d12—Legendary—Modify 

**Description:** [Inst / Self or creature] The caster or chosen creature is hastened or slowed during combat for his or its following action. The caster twists time to move initiative for the target’s next action by up to 4 in either direction, either faster or slower. The save against the effect is Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience if resisted.

**Petrify:** d12+4—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Creature] This dreaded spell turns the affected creature to stone or some other hard substance, rendering it immobilized and helpless until the spell is broken or a saving throw made (Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance).

**Stand Still:** d12—Legendary—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature] A limited and less powerful version of Time Halt, the spell causes time to stop at the instant of activation for one creature for as long as the spell is maintained. The effect stays with the paralyzed body of the target. There may be some benefits: projectiles that would hit the affected creature halt at the point of impact, but hang in midair. Knocking such projectiles down drops them harmlessly to the ground. Magic spells cast specifically at the creature take effect only after the Standstill spell has ended. Magic not targeting the creature takes effect immediately but with a delayed effect on the creature at a standstill. Once Standstill has ended, physical manifestations of magic spells, along with halted missiles, resolve their original rolls and effects

**Time Halt:** d12+5—Legendary— Activate (5 SP)

**Description:** [Inst / Special] The magic-wielder makes time halt for all but himself in the area of effect (2 × MV in radius), allowing him to perform actions while the spell is maintained. Within the area of effect the caster may move freely, manipulate objects, and cause harm within the scope of the regular rules — but opponents are defenseless and take damage directly to passive defense. Any creature entering the area is immediately frozen in time; likewise, projectiles halt immediately but hang in midair. Those looking into the area see only the positions and actions of those at the very instant of casting and cannot see the caster moving. Magic spells cast into the area itself take effect only after the spell has ended. Once Time Halt has ended, any missile attacks and magic spells, including damaging bolts of lightning or explosions frozen in midair as time stops, resolve their original rolls and effects.

MYSTICISM

Offense Spells

**Mystic Assault:** d4-d12—Variable—Harm

**Description:** Mystics wield the Mystic Bolt as their fundamental offensive spell, channeling inner energy to manifest in various mystical forms, each reflecting different aspects of their discipline and intent. These manifestations include:

**Kinetic Bolt:** A shimmering bolt that delivers concussive force, visibly distorting the air.

**Psychic Bolt:** An almost invisible wave that pierces the mind, causing mental anguish.

**Shadow Bolt:** A tendril of darkness that saps vitality, inducing a chilling effect.

Mystic Bolt can be enhanced and modified with the following variations:

**Range and Dimensions**

**Maximum Range:** Calculated as (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet. If a Mastery Die is used, the range is doubled.

**Mystic Bolt:** A 1-foot diameter bolt that targets a single enemy.

**Mystic Stream:** A continuous stream of energy, 2 feet in width and (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet in length.

**Mystic Burst:** An area-of-effect attack with a radius of (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Wizardry bonuses in feet. Mastery Die doubles the area of effect.

**Threat Points and Challenge Die**

**Basic Cast of Mystic Bolt:** The basic cast of Mystic Bolt (or Eldritch Bolt) does not require a challenge die and inflicts harm based on the caster's Competence → Expertise (+ Wizardry or Theurgy) roll, making it accessible for novice mystics.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

**Mystic Stream (Challenge d6):** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round. Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

**Mystic Burst (Challenge d8/d10):** Converts the spell to affect an area. At d8, it becomes an area explosion affecting multiple enemies, while at d10, the burst’s radius and damage increase significantly.

**Afflictions**

Mystics can apply one affliction to their attack, which directly impacts the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and requires additional Spirit Points.

**Mystic Disorientation (Challenge d4):** Disrupts the target's mind, causing confusion and reducing their initiative by one battle phase (e.g., reducing Prowess from d10 to d8). The effect can intensify, increasing the difficulty by +1 per additional phase reduced. This affliction lasts one round unless otherwise specified.

**Mystic Confusion (Challenge d6):** Leaves the target struggling to focus, disrupting concentration. If in close combat, the target may trigger an opportunity attack unless using a tactical withdrawal. The target is unable to attack until the same battle phase in the following round, but may still move or assist others. This effect typically lasts one round.

**Mystic Terror (Challenge d8):** Strikes the target with intense fear, preventing them from attacking the mystic and forcing them to flee until the next battle phase. If others block their escape, the target may attack them to escape, unless they succeed on a Fortitude → Willpower save to avoid harming allies. This effect lasts one round unless otherwise specified.

**Mystic Overload (Challenge d10+1):** Overwhelms the target’s senses with psychic energy, inducing confusion or fear. These intangible attacks bypass physical defenses, affecting the target’s mental and emotional state directly. Competence → Perception checks automatically fail with a potential -5 penalty to compensate, and attacks suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. Effects typically last one round unless otherwise specified, and specialized magical defenses or heightened perception may be required to resist or counter this effect

Defense Spells

**Arcane Shielding (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

The mystic conjures a protective barrier of psychic energy that envelops the target, deflecting incoming threats before they can inflict harm. This shield manifests as a semi-transparent energy field, often appearing as dark tendrils or shimmering distortions that warp reality around the target.

**Shielding Effect:** Reduces incoming threat points by an amount equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 reduces threat by 1, a d6 reduces by 2, and so on, up to a maximum reduction of 5 at d12.

Maintenance: The caster may maintain the shield, but incurs a cumulative –1 penalty to other actions for each additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Interaction with Physical Shields:** If the target uses a physical shield, combine threat reductions, divide by 2, and round up.

**Arcane Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

Through sheer force of will, the mystic envelops the target in a layer of protective energy that fortifies them after active defenses are breached. This armor adapts to threats, providing resilience against physical and magical harm. Variations include:

**Psychic Armor:** Reinforces the mind and body, reducing damage from mental and physical attacks.

**Shadow Armor:** Wraps the target in shadows, absorbing and dispersing incoming damage.

**Ethereal Armor:** Glows with otherworldly light, shielding against supernatural threats.

**Armor Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank. For example, a d4 version provides +1 DR, d6 adds +2 DR, and so on, up to a maximum of +4 DR at d10. The DR applies after the target’s active defense is depleted.

Maintenance: Maintaining this magical armor requires concentration, with the caster incurring a –1 penalty to other actions per additional round it is sustained.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** Each casting requires 1 SP per rank of the Challenge Die. A d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP, and so on, up to 5 SP for d12.

**Interaction with Physical Armor:**

**If Mystic Armor's DR Die is Higher:** Use the mystic armor's DR.

**If Physical Armor's DR Die is Higher:** Use the physical armor's DR.

**If Mystic Armor's DR Die is Lower:** Add +1 DR per die rank of the armor spell to the physical armor's DR.

**Versatility of Mysticism Defense:**

**Mystics wield Arcane Shielding and Arcane Armor to adapt to various threats by either bolstering their defensive capabilities with robust** barriers or enhancing their resilience against sustained damage. In addition to these, Mystics can conjure Arcane Walls to establish broader protective measures on the battlefield.

**Arcane Walls**

**Types of Walls:**

**Flame Wall:** Blocks physical and ranged attacks, dealing minor fire damage to those who attempt to pass through without proper resistance.

**Wind Wall:** Deflects projectiles and disperses gas-based attacks, providing partial cover against ranged threats.

**Shadow Veil:** Creates an area of darkness, reducing visibility and granting concealment to allies within.

**Challenge Die and SP Cost:**

**Similar to Arcane Shielding and Arcane Armor, the potency of Arcane Walls scales with the Challenge Die rank selected during** casting. Each type may have specific modifiers based on its elemental nature.

**Maintenance:**

**Maintaining an Arcane Wall requires concentration, incurring a –1 penalty to other actions for each additional round it is sustained.**

**Customization:**

**Mystics can combine different elemental walls to create hybrid defenses, offering tailored protection against diverse threats.**

Common

**Confusion:** d4—Common—Afflict 

**Description:** [M / Creature or Area] This spell confuses the target or targets within the area of effect, making them uncertain of their actions. Those affected roll at –1 per level of the caster on their next action. Casting Modifiers: one creature is challenge die d4; +1 added to challenge die per additional creature affected

**Detect Magic:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell allows the caster to detect any magical auras within the area of effect, revealing the presence of any enchanted or cursed objects or creatures. It functions exactly as does Identify Magic (qv), except that it is a path spell for a mystic, who can augment it with a mastery die

**Ethereal Sight:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self] [M / Self] This spell bestows the caster with the temporary ability to perceive into the ethereal plane, within a radius determined by the caster's Competence → Awareness ability branch. The range begins at 15 feet at level 1 and increases by 5 feet per additional level. For the purpose of this spell, 'ethereal' encompasses both energy-based entities like limbo spirits and traditionally invisible or incorporeal beings such as specific types of ghosts. This means the caster can identify both kinds of ethereal beings within the spell's effective range..

**Levitation:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster causes the target to levitate up to 10 feet above the ground and remain in mid-air. The target can move in any direction, but cannot exceed the maximum height. The target cannot take any other actions while levitating, and the spell lasts for up to 1 minute.

**Mindfulness:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M/ Self] This spell clears the caster's mind, allowing them to focus more intently on a particular task. It temporarily boosts the caster's next action, providing +1 to Competence or empathy related ability tests.

**Phase Shift:** d4—Common—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster transitions into a temporary ethereal state, enabling them to move through solid objects for a limited duration. This duration lasts for a number of rounds equal to the caster's total MV in the relevant ability branch; each round consists of 10 seconds. To calculate the spell's total duration in minutes, simply divide (MV × 10) by 60. Be aware that magically fortified objects—such as enchanted doors, gates, or walls specifically designed to block or detect ethereal entities—can disrupt the spell's effectiveness, necessitating a re-roll of the challenge die. The complexity of the magical enchantment dictates the re-roll: a basic ward may require a d6, while a more potent blockage demands a d8.

**Silence:** d4—Common—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell muffles all normal sound within the area of effect, creating an almost completely silent zone. Any attempts to make noise within the area are at a disadvantage, adding +1 to the challenge die. The area of effect is a circle (sphere) of feet diameter equal to the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV x2 + Wizardry bonus

**Soothing Balm:** d4—Common—Restore 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster invokes a healing spell that coats the target with a mystical balm, restoring health equal to the caster's MV in either the Competence or Expertise ability branch—whichever the caster chooses. Simultaneously, the spell imbues the target with a soothing effect, making them temporarily immune to fear-based influences for a duration of one round per caster level. Casting Modifiers: The base challenge die for affecting a single creature is a d4. For each additional target, add +1 to the challenge die.

**Soothing Mists:** d4—Common—Restore 

**Description:** [M / Creature] A mist envelops a creature, soothing its wounds. Health recovery depends on the caster's Competence MV or Expertise MV, at the caster's discretion. Casting Modifiers: A d4 challenge die applies to one creature. For each additional hit point restored, increase the challenge die by +1. Choice of Defense: At the time of casting, the caster may decide whether the healing replenishes the active or passive defense pool.

Uncommon

**Discern Soul:** d6—Uncommon—Activate 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The mystic draws upon preternatural vision to sense the nature of the target’s essential self. The spell reveals an aura around the target, seen only by the mystic, granting some limited information about personality and spiritual characteristics. 

The aura radiates 2–3 feet from the body, and has a predominant color. White: tending toward goodness or order, a potential ally. Black: tending toward evil or chaos, a potential enemy. Violet: tending toward neutrality, intentions variable. Blue: otherworldly, preternatural, or supernatural. Colorless: shielded

**Mind Shield:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] This spell blocks any power that allows another creature to read the mystic’s mind. The caster is protected from an attempt to pry into thoughts or memories so long as it is maintained. Those attempting to read the mind of one so shielded know they are being blocked by magic. However, the spell does not work if the mystic’s passive defense is brought to zero by other magical attacks.

**Object Read:** d6—Uncommon—Activate. 

**Description [M / Object]:** This spell allows the caster to explore an object's historical imprint. It reveals a montage of past events related to the object, be they mundane or extraordinary.

**Mind Blade:** d6—Uncommon—Harm 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The Mystic channels mental energy into a shimmering blade, inflicting harm equal to their Wizardry rank +2. The blade is visible but can pass through solid objects at a cost of 2 spirit points, potentially enabling surprise attacks.

**See Aura:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] The mystic can see the psychic aura of a person or object. This spell reveals different information than Discern Soul. It shows a general state of health, such as sick, weary, or wounded. A roll of 20 or better can determine the type of being, e.g., human, dwarf, elf, from aura alone. It shows the presence of magic, and on a roll of 24 or better can distinguish the type of magic present.

**See Invisible:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] Can see creatures and objects hidden by an invisibility spell or power. If a person’s or creature’s invisibility is due to their own spell or power, roll an opposed roll to determine if See Invisible penetrates the invisibility. Casting modifier: +2 to make normal visual checks against hidden or concealed creatures and objects in addition.

**Sense Power:** d6—Uncommon—Activate

It grants a +2 on all rolls to respond to perceived danger or avoid simple or total surprise.

Esoteric

**Cosmic Shift:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Self] The caster can bend space and time to his or her will, allowing him or her to move faster, dodge attacks with ease, and even teleport short distances (one yard per level). The spell provides a d6 bonus to active defense for the duration of the spell. Casting Modifiers: Increase the challenge die by +1 to teleport 3 yards further or to make the spell last 3 rounds after ceasing to maintain it. 

**Fathom:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Self] Casting this spell allows the mystic instantaneous, intuitive insight into how to resolve a puzzle, dilemma, or riddle impeding the progress of a quest or mission. Failing the casting means the mystic intuits nothing new and understands the spell was a failure. Success means the GM can grant some clues to help the players when stuck.

**Mind Read:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Creature] By activating this spell, the caster gains access to the surface thoughts and current emotional state of the target. This allows for better detection of deceit. Each probe into thoughts or emotions permits the target a series of saving throws (Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance), even if the spell maintains its effect.

**Mystic Lore:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Self] Information relevant to the adventuring party’s plans manifests in the caster’s mind. The GM gives the mystic a hint about a curious person, creature, place, or thing pertinent to the situation. It can be used to solve riddles or to help one figure out serious dilemmas. A failed roll brings no added information to mind whatsoever.

**Premonition:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] The mystic gains some hint about impending danger or risks associated with current plans or intended actions. The premonition comes in symbolic imagery, or sometimes interpretable visions, at the GM’s discretion. The premonition cannot extend beyond the possible consequence of the action, plan, or intention imagined. Premonitions do not show outcomes but give an idea of the level of danger or range of possibilities.

**Psychic Beacon:** d8—Esoteric—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Area] A psychic lure comes into being, capturing the attention of all creatures within a specific radius. The lure can serve to divert enemies or set up an ambush. Its effective radius equals 1 yard per point of the caster's ability branch, doubled for mastery levels. Intelligent or wary creatures like goblins, orcs, or woodland animals may attempt a valorous saving throw (Fortitude → Endurance → Vitality or Resilience) to resist its pull. If the spell targets a specific species or genus (e.g., orcs, goblins), the saving throw suffers a -1 penalty per caster level.

**Reassemble:** d8—Esoteric—Modify 

**Description [Inst / Object]:** A broken, potentially complex structure or mechanical device is restored to full function. Targeted objects will be repaired, even if broken apart and missing parts. Missing parts will manifest out of thin air if small and non-magical in nature.

**Shadow Walk:** d8—Esoteric—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Special] Description: [M / Special] This spell lets the caster step into any nearby shadow, even one cast by objects or creatures close by, along with all items normally worn and carried, and instantly jump to an adjoining shadow. In this state, the caster can walk within the shadow at up to twice his normal speed, and jump to adjoining shadows no more than six feet distant. 

If a bright light source chases away the shadow in which the caster is concealed, he is thrown back to the light source’s border. In a pitch-black room, the caster can will himself to any point in the room without taking a step (if able to see in shadow). The shadow walker is not impervious to physical threats (see Form of Night), and can only jump from one shadow to another once per round while maintaining the spell. The caster can also position himself for a surprise attack, materializing within a creature’s shadow and simultaneously attacking, gaining simple surprise on that round. Perception rolls used to detect the recipient are at –4

Occult

**Continuous Shadow:** d10—Occult—Modify

**Description:** [M / Area] The spell creates an area of dim shadow through which only the caster can see clearly. Others succeeding with a Perception roll can attack anyone in the area of effect (2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy Bonus MV, radius) at a penalty of –4. Failure means the attacker is striking blind, at a penalty of –8. A Continuous Shadow spell can be used as the source of shadow for all spells that use shadows.

**Dreamwalk:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster enters the dreams of a sleeping creature. Upon a successful casting roll, the caster forces it into a dream state if it is not already dreaming. The caster may influence the dreams, bringing new elements into play (shifting landscapes, conditions, creatures, and places), conjuring up creatures or events suited to the interaction’s aims. Any stressful event or scary phenomenon so manifested grants the sleeper a Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance saving throw to awaken, else he or she takes psychic threat points equal to the caster’s initial roll. A successful save means the target immediately wakes, but failing forces him or her to remain asleep for another round, after which another attempt can be made. The caster cannot simultaneously extract memories to use against the target in dreams with this power, but some mythic variations that enable this are spoken of by sages. There is a 10% chance per non-damaging use of either 1) inducing a future positive or negative reaction to something or someone (via dream symbolism, leaving no magical traces of influence), or 2) extracting some useful information, although this will be wrapped in dream symbolism (the GM should invent allusions and puzzles to suit).The caster chooses the effect.

**Ethereal Projection:** d10—Occult— Modify

**Description:** [M / Creature or Self] The caster can project his or her consciousness outside the body, exploring the world in a spectral form. While in this state, the caster can move through solid objects, fly, and access inaccessible places. Casting Modifiers: Increase the challenge die by +1 to project the consciousness of an additional creature or increase the spell’s duration make the spell last 3 rounds after ceasing to maintain it.

**Foreknowledge:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] This spell, a more powerful version of Sixth Sense, gives the mystic the ability to sense danger and to navigate in unfamiliar surroundings. It grants a +6 on all rolls to respond to perceived danger or avoid simple or total surprise. 

Usually, this involves the Competence → Perception branch, either opposed to Competence → Adroitness if being stalked, or against a challenge die based on the nature of the surroundings (GM’s call). A caster who maintains the spell also gets an automatic roll to detect ambushes, even if the assailants are invisible and silent.

**Manipulate Shadow:** d10—Occult—Harm, Afflict

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] This spell gives physical substance to an area of shadow that animates and can be manipulated into many forms to make a devastating attack or to capture and hold a targeted enemy. Range is 10 × basic tier MV in feet. An attack on the target causes threat points equal to the caster’s roll. The attack manifests physically and visibly as coalesced shadow and can be blocked with a shield, avoided with active defense, or absorbed by armor. Alternatively, the shadow form can be made to wrap around a target and hold it fast, like tendrils of shadowy steel, rendering it unable to move or attack so long as the spell is maintained. The one captured may make a Fortitude roll to break free, and can make limited attempts to defend at one-half active defense

**Release Mind:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The mystic grants the target creature power to release itself from a mind-bending magical affliction. The target creature gets an immediate saving throw, using either the caster’s ability branch or its own Fortitude → Willpower branch, whichever is higher.

Legendary

**Control Humanoid:** d12—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Creature] This spell lets the caster control the mind of one humanoid creature. The victim’s mind is taken over, the caster’s thoughts insinuated into the brain, changing opinions or perceptions. The target creature’s mind is bent to the caster’s will, so the creature will follow instructions, even attacking allies. However, it will not harm itself. The target creature gets a Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance save against the spell

**Form of Night:** d12—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [Inst / Special] This spell turns the caster into shadow stuff, along with all items normally worn and carried. The caster can step into and completely merge with any nearby shadow, even one cast by objects or creatures close by. In this state, the caster can travel within the shadow, moving up to twice his normal running speed, and jump to adjoining shadows no more than six feet distant. If a bright light source chases away the shadow in which the caster is concealed, he stays in shadow form but is thrown back to the light source’s border. 

If the light source obliterates all shadow, then the caster is jolted back into his normal form and blinded for a round. In a pitch-black room, the caster can will himself to merge without taking a step and can travel to any part of the room. In shadow state, the caster is impervious to all normal or preternatural physical threat points. He may still cast spells. This will not reveal him, although the direction of the activation energy source might be detected. The caster can also position himself for a surprise attack, materializing within a creature’s shadow and simultaneously attacking, gaining total surprise on that round. Perception rolls used to detect the recipient are at –5. One cannot activate this spell and rematerialize in the same round.

**Hypnotic Suggestion:** d12—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The caster can place a command or insinuate an idea into the mind of another, leading to actions that seem rational to the victim. Commands should be short. An additional roll to save is allowed when the suggested action is to be completed. Once the action is complete, the spell’s compunction wears off. The save is against Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance 

**Induce Sleep:** d12—Legendary—Afflict

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] The spell makes the victim fall asleep even if not tired. The victim rolls versus Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance to remain awake. Failing the roll means the victim remains asleep for rounds equal to a roll of the caster’s Competence rank die (d4 to d12) or until awakened

**Mind Control:** d12+4—Legendary—Afflict (4 SP)

**Description:** [M / Creature] This spell lets the caster infiltrate and control the mind of any sentient targeted creature, overwhelming its will. The afflicted creature follows any command short of suicide, even if it harms allies, so long as language or general intent is understood. The power can continue to dominate a mind once out of sight. The subject may make a saving throw each round, versus Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance. Success ends the condition, regardless of distance

**Super Intuition:** d12—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] This spell grants a mystic the intuitive sense, the better to notice things in dangerous or challenging situations. It is a non-visual form of premonition, like a tingling sensation or general feeling of warning that increases the caster’s Perception base die rank by 3 steps. If the Perception base rank is already d12, then increase rolls by +3.

Hieraticism

Offense Spells

**Dvine Assault:** d4-d12—Variable— Harm

**Description:** Hieraticists wield the Divine Bolt as their universal offensive spell within the Hieraticism manifestation, channeling divine power to deliver righteous judgment and harm their adversaries.

**Entropic Bolt:** Crackles with dark energy, accelerating decay and undermining the target's vitality.

**Condemnation Bolt:** Resonates with the sound of divine judgment, striking fear and pain into the hearts of the wicked.

The Divine Bolt spell can be enhanced and modified with the following variations:

**Divine Bolt:** A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a single target with precision.

**Divine Stream:** A continuous stream of divine energy with a width of 2 feet and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Divine Burst:** An area-of-effect attack with a radius equal to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Theurgy bonuses in feet.

**Potential Harm and Challenge Die**

**Basic Cast of Divine Bolt:** The basic cast of Divine Bolt does not require a challenge die and inflicts harm based on the caster's Competence → Expertise (+ Theurgy) roll, making it accessible for novice hieraticists.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

**Divine Stream (Challenge d6):** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round. Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

**Divine Burst (Challenge d8):** Converts the spell to affect an area. The burst becomes an area explosion affecting multiple enemies, with its radius and damage determined by the formula (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Theurgy bonuses in feet.

Hieraticists can apply one affliction to their attack, which directly impacts the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and requires additional Spirit Points.

**Afflictions Breakdown**

**Divine Fear (Challenge d8):** Resonates with the sound of divine judgment, instilling fear in the target. The target is unable to attack the hieraticist and is forced to retreat until the next battle phase. If others block their escape, the target may attack them in an attempt to flee, unless they succeed on a Fortitude → Willpower save. This effect lasts for one round unless otherwise specified.

**Divine Overwhelm (Challenge d10+1):** Overwhelms the target’s senses with divine energy, inducing confusion or fear. These intangible attacks bypass physical defenses, affecting the target’s mental and emotional state directly. Competence → Perception checks automatically fail with a potential -5 penalty to compensate, and attacks suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. Effects typically last one round unless otherwise specified, and specialized magical defenses or heightened perception may be required to resist or counter this effect

Defense Spells

Hieraticists construct their defenses with Divine Shield and Divine Armor, both channeling celestial power to protect the caster or allies. The strength of these spells scales with the Challenge Die rank chosen during casting.

**Divine Mantle:** A divine cloak that mitigates incoming attacks.

**Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if d4 rank is used).

**Types of Walls:**

**Flame Wall:** Blocks physical attacks, dealing minor fire damage to those attempting to pass.

**Description:** [M / Creature] The caster channels divine energy to banish a single undead target within short range. The spell affects undead up to minor power level at levels 1-2, standard at 3-4, and exceptional at level 5.

The focus object must remain intact for the spell's duration. The challenge roll is a d6, with an additional cost of 2 Spirit Points due to the spell's manipulation of fundamental forces. The spell can be maintained as a ritual, allowing the theurgist to bypass action penalties. The ritual's duration equals the time spent in unbroken casting, and the caster gains a +2 bonus to the casting roll for every additional ten minutes spent, up to +5. The spell fizzles if the focus object breaks or if the caster fails a Fortitude → Willpower save during a renewal ritual. 

Esoteric

**Doomsday Premonition:** d8—Esoteric— Activate 

**Description:** [M / Self or Creature] The spell grants a +3 bonus on all ability tests directly related to survival, navigation, or avoiding danger. While maintaining the spell, the caster incurs a -3 penalty to all ability tests. However, if the spell is cast on themselves, this penalty does not apply to tests directly related to the areas of premonition (survival, navigation, avoiding danger). The maximum duration equals the caster's Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy bonus maximum MV score in rounds. Concentration checks are required for durations beyond this limit, with a target number based on the spell's -3 maintenance penalty. 

**Mystical Regeneration:** d8—Esoteric— Restore 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The priest channels divine energy to heal a creature's wounds. The spell restores health points to the target equal to the ability test roll.

**Rejuvenate:** d8—Esoteric—Restore 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature] This spell focuses on restoring the recipient's active defense by the amount rolled on the ability test. It specifically targets muscles and tendons to relieve tension and improve mobility. 

**Remove Curse:** d8—Esoteric—Restore 

**Description:** [Inst / Creature or Object] This spell removes an existing curse on an object or creature. Roll this ability branch versus the initial roll of the curse: it must exceed that roll to break it. 

**Unbind Spirit:** d8—Esoteric—Activate 

**Description [Inst / Area]:** The priest invokes a supernatural force to unbind cursed spirits from a particular place or object. This spell is often used to unbind spirits bound to a certain area by a curse, allowing them to depart into the next phase of their ghostly existence. The caster’s ability branch roll must exceed the initial roll of the curse than bound the spirits to unbind them.

Occult 

**Desolate Curse:** d10 (Ritual)—Occult—Destroy 

**Description:** [Special / Creature] The priest invokes a powerful curse that causes the target to wither and decay rapidly. The target must make a successful ability test roll to avoid being afflicted with a debilitating sickness that deals ongoing damage to its passive defense and physical attributes. The curse lasts for a number of days equal to the theurgist’s ability test roll or until it is removed through magical means, and inflicts 1d4 passive damage per day. 

**Entreat Entity:** d10—Occult—Activate 

**Description:** [Inst / Special] In times of danger, the theurgist can use this spell to call upon his patron deity for a favor. The effects are random, depending on the petitioned god’s whim, or the circumstances as determined by the GM (with narrative input encouraged from the player).

**Omniscient Eye:** d10—Occult—Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The theurgist channels the power of his or her deity to grant the target unparalleled insight and knowledge. The target gains the ability to see and understand things beyond normal perception, such as magical auras, hidden doors, and invisible creatures.

**Soul Transmutation:** d10 (Ritual)—Occult— Modify 

**Description:** [M / Creature] The priest conducts a ritual to transfer the soul of a willing creature into a new body, which must be of the same species and prepared in advance. Upon successful transference, the target may experience temporary disorientation. To maintain the soul in the new body, the target must wear a phylactery prepared through means of Arcanum. The new body is not immortal, and so age of the deceased host matters, and the host must not have been dead for more than an hour. The spell can be dispelled by Dispel Magic or similar effects, severing the soul once again from the new body, but only if the phylactery is also destroyed.

Legendary

**Create Undead:** d12—Legendary—Activate. 

**Description [M / Area]:** The priests points at dead humanoid bodies or skeletal remains and instantly animates them. This spell raises one or two undead up from the ground, or even from their graves, to attack enemies upon command or otherwise do the bidding of the caster.

**Commune with the Dead:** d12—Legendary—Activate

**Description:** [M / Self] Allows the caster to question the dead. The dead can relate events of the location’s past or speak of hidden things. Even when asked specific questions, their answers can often be vague and open to interpretation. GMs can apply a disadvantage or difficulty based on the question. Failure of the ability roll will yield no answer at all. Failure to exceed the challenge die will yield wrong answers! 

**Regeneration:** d12—Legendary—Restore 

**Description:** [M / Special] This spell petitions the deity, pantheon, or powers worshiped to regenerate lost limbs and body parts. The restoration occurs instantly when successfully cast by the caster simply laying hands on the recipient.

**Summon Spirit:** d12—Legendary—Activate.

Druidry

Offense Spells

**Nature Assault:** d4-d12—Variable— Harm

**Description:** Druids wield the Nature Bolt as their universal offensive spell within the Druidry manifestation, channeling the raw forces of nature to deliver concentrated harm to their adversaries. This spell can manifest in various elemental forms, each reflecting the druid's deep connection to the natural world:

**Thorn Bolt:** Erupts from the ground, impaling the target with sharp wooden spikes.

**Wind Bolt:** Manifests as a sudden gust, buffeting the target with concussive force.

**Water Bolt:** Sends a jet of water or mud, potentially knocking the target off balance.

**Fire Bolt (for fire-aligned druids):** Ignites upon contact, causing burning damage.

The Nature Bolt spell can be enhanced and modified with the following variations:

**Range and Dimensions**

**Maximum Range:** Calculated as (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Nature Bolt:** A 1-foot diameter bolt that strikes a single target with precision.

**Nature Stream:** A continuous stream of elemental energy with a width of 2 feet and a length equal to (Competence → Expertise MV) × 4 feet.

**Nature Burst:** An area-of-effect attack with a radius equal to (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Druidry bonuses in feet.

**Potential Harm and Challenge Die**

**Basic Cast of Nature Bolt:** The basic cast of Nature Bolt does not require a challenge die and inflicts harm based on the caster's Competence → Expertise (+ Druidry) roll, making it accessible for novice druids.

**Challenge Die and Threat Point Increase:** To increase the threat points of the spell, the caster can introduce a challenge die. The initial increase is always to a d4 challenge die, which adds +1 to the threat points. Each subsequent increase in the challenge die (d6, d8, d10, d12) raises the threat points by an additional +1. For example, a d6 challenge die adds +2 to the threat points, a d8 adds +3, and so on.

**Nature Stream (Challenge d6):** Increases the Challenge Die by one step (e.g., d4 to d6) and requires a maintenance penalty of -1 per additional round. Threat Points increase by +2 per round.

**Nature Burst (Challenge d8):** Converts the spell to affect an area. The burst becomes an area explosion affecting multiple enemies, with its radius and damage determined by the formula (2 × Competence → Expertise MV) + Druidry bonuses in feet.

**Afflictions**

Druids can apply one affliction to their attack, which directly impacts the target. Each affliction increases the Challenge Die and requires additional Spirit Points.

**Afflictions Breakdown**

**Nature Entangle (Challenge d4):** Strikes the target with thorny vines, ensnaring them and reducing their mobility. The target's movement speed is reduced, and attacks suffer a penalty to potential harm. This effect typically lasts for one round unless otherwise specified.

**Elemental Drench (Challenge d6):** Channels water or mud to disorient the target, potentially knocking them off balance. The target's resilience is reduced, making them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks. This effect lasts for one round unless specified otherwise.

**Elemental Fear (Challenge d8):** Resonates with the chaotic forces of nature, instilling fear in the target. The target is unable to attack the druid and is forced to retreat until the next battle phase. If others block their escape, the target may attack them in an attempt to flee, unless they succeed on a Fortitude → Willpower save. This effect lasts for one round unless otherwise specified.

**Elemental Overwhelm (Challenge d10+1):** Overwhelms the target’s senses with elemental energy, inducing confusion or fear. These intangible attacks bypass physical defenses, affecting the target’s mental and emotional state directly. Competence → Perception checks automatically fail with a potential -5 penalty to compensate, and attacks suffer a -4 penalty to potential harm. Effects typically last one round unless otherwise specified, and specialized magical defenses or heightened perception may be required to resist or counter this effect

**Area of Effect (AoE):** A radius equal to (2×Competence→Expertise MV)+Druidry bonuses feet.

**Maximum Range:** (Competence→Expertise MV)×4 feet.

**Afflictions and Effects:** Can apply area-affecting afflictions like confusion, fear, or blindness.

Defense Spells

**Nature Shield (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

**Description:** The druid invokes the protective embrace of nature, conjuring a shield to deflect incoming threats. This shield can take several forms, each embodying the resilience of the wilderness:

**Bark Shield:** Covers the target in a layer of thick bark, absorbing blows.

**Grove Shield:** Surrounds the target with thorns and vines, hindering attackers.

**Stone Shield:** Forms a wall of earth and rock, creating a sturdy defense.

**Flame Ward:** (For fire-aligned druids) Encircles the target with a ring of fire, deterring attackers.

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

**Maintenance:** Requires concentration, incurring a -1 penalty per die rank to other actions for each additional round.

**Interaction with Physical Shields:** Combine threat reductions from both shields, divide by 2, and round up.

**Nature Armor (d4 to d12 — Common — Protect)**

**Description:**

**Description:** The druid calls upon nature's resilience to envelop the target in protective energy, fortifying them after active defenses are breached. This armor manifests as different forms of natural defense:

**Bark Armor:** Covers the target in tough bark, absorbing damage.

**Stone Armor:** Hardens the target's skin to the toughness of rock.

**Water Veil:** Surrounds the target in water, reducing impacts and fire damage.

**Flame Shield:** (For fire-aligned druids) Cloaks the target in flames, deterring attackers and absorbing damage.

**Effect:** Provides Damage Reduction (DR) equal to the Challenge Die rank (e.g., roll d4 for DR if using d4).

**Spirit Point (SP) Cost:** 1 SP per die rank (e.g., d4 costs 1 SP, d6 costs 2 SP).

**Maintenance:** Requires concentration, incurring a -1 penalty per die rank to other actions for each additional round.

**Interaction with Physical Armor:** Use the higher DR between Nature Armor and physical armor. If Nature Armor's DR is lower, add +1 per rank of the armor spell to the physical DR.

**If Physical Armor's DR Die is Higher:** Use the physical armor's DR.

**If Nature Armor's DR Die is Lower:** Add +1 DR per die rank of the armor spell to the physical armor's DR.

**Nature Walls**

**Types of Walls:**

Druids can create Nature Walls to provide area protection and control the battlefield.

**Flame Wall:** Blocks attacks and deals minor fire damage to those attempting to pass.

**Wind Wall:** Deflects projectiles and disperses gas-based threats.

**Shadow Veil:** Creates an area of darkness, reducing visibility and providing concealment to allies.

**Challenge Die and SP Cost:** Scales with Challenge Die rank, similar to Nature Shield and Nature Armor.

**Maintenance:** Requires concentration, with a -1 penalty per die rank to other actions for each additional round.

**Customization:** Druids can combine different types of Nature Walls to create hybrid defenses, adapting to specific threatss.

**Description:** [M / Self] Grants the power to question plants. The caster taps into the awareness of the plant life and may ask specific questions, such as if any sentient being has passed recently.

**Summon Animal:** d4 (Variable)—Common—Activate

**Description:**[M / Creature] The druid summons a normal animal, which is under his or her control and can take basic commands. The size and type of the animal determine challenge die.

**Bramble Wall:** d6—Uncommon—Activate, Restore (1 SP)

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell creates a wall of thorny plants instantly from out of the earth. It uses dormant plant life and can thus be cast virtually anywhere there is earth. The wall extends to the ability branch’s MV in feet for length and height, but the druid can reshape its form. The wall is a foot thick of prickly shrubs and tangled vines, with structural hit points equal to the druid’s ability branch MV ×2. _Casting Modifiers_: +1 to challenge die per extra foot thick. Those trying to charge rather than cut through the wall take d4 potential harm +1 per extra foot thick.

**Control Animal:** d6—Uncommon—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Creature]: This spell lets the caster control the actions of the target animal. The target animal has a saving throw based on its size; d4 for small, d6 for medium, d8 for large animals, and ±1 for species or individual independence or docility. Wise druids know that cats save each round 

**Gust:** d6—Uncommon—Harm, Modify (1 SP) 

**Description:** [Inst / Area] The caster summons a forceful gust of wind that sweeps through a designated area, inflicting damage and knocking targets prone.

Esoteric

**Plant Automaton:** d8—Esoteric—Activate 

**Description:** [M / Special] Creates a small creature of vegetation to do the caster’s bidding. This spell animates vegetation rather than summoning a creature, so there is no save against it.

**Tangle Trap:** d8—Esoteric—Afflict

**Description:** [M / Area] Creates a web of thorny vines that entangle and immobilize selected opponents within the area of effect.

**Plant Behemoth:** d10—Occult—Activate

**Description:** [M / Special] This spell creates a large plant creature to do the caster’s bidding. It animates vegetation (about a medium tree’s worth) rather than summoning a creature, so there is no save against it. The plant behemoth is under the caster’s control and can follow simple instructions or move about and attack on its own. It is an exceptional creature: 3d4 threat points, hit points = threat point MV, d6 armor.

Legendary

**Magical Transformation:** d12—Legendary—Modify

**Description:** [M / Self] This spell allows the druid to become a magical creature, such as a powerful demon or a wise unicorn. The druid gains the creature’s powers and abilities, including the ability to move as the creature moves and control its magical abilities to some extent. The spell also grants the druid immunity to attacks based on the creature’s magical abilities. 

After the first round, the druid must maintain control over the chosen form, as detailed in the section of Chapter 8, Rules Arbitration. The druid must roll against the relevant ability branch, chosen at the time of casting, with a penalty based on the size and nature of the chosen creature (as described in the Summoned Creature Modifiers). 

Modifiers for summoning powers, such as hit points and penalties for larger creatures, do not apply to this spell since the druid is not summoning another creature but transforming himself or herself. However, the rules for maintaining control over a summoned creature after the first round apply, as the druid must maintain control over the chosen form. Spirit points may be expended to nullify penalties and keep the chosen form under control

**Plant Mastery:** d12—Legendary—Modify, Harm

**Description:** [M / Area] This spell grants the druid control over all plant life within a 30-foot radius that moves with the druid and designated allies. Allies within the area benefit from a -5 shielding effect to active defense. The druid can communicate with plants, offering a +5 bonus to Perception checks related to area knowledge. Enemies within the area experience a movement penalty, dropping down one battle phase and potentially suffering 1d12 threat points for every 5 feet moved. Interactions with flammable materials may result in a d4 threat point hazard.

Crafting Spells with Defense Negation

Creating spells that bypass defenses, including armor, requires mastery of advanced spellcraft, extensive preparation, and often the use of specialized magical components. 

These spells are typically crafted ahead of time rather than improvised in combat, especially for non-mages. Mages possess the arcane finesse and dweomers necessary for such intricate casting. The following sections outline key considerations and methods for crafting defense-negating spells across various magical paths, adhering to the defense negation mechanics of the Eldritch RPG.

 Defense-Negating Effects

Spells that bypass defenses target physical and magical protections through specific effects. Force effects ignore physical barriers with raw energy, ethereal attacks strike the target’s essence directly, corrosive energies weaken physical defenses, and psychic effects overwhelm mental fortitude. Non-mages must craft these spells in advance, storing them in scrolls, potions, or enchanted items for future use. Defense negation requires Spirit Points (SP) and challenge rolls based on the target’s defenses. To bypass armor, the challenge die matches the armor’s rank (e.g., d10 for plate mail, costing 10 SP). Shield negation ranges from d8 to d12, with SP costs from 3 to 5 depending on the shield’s level (-1 to -3). Bypassing Active Defense (AD) requires a d12 challenge die roll and 5 SP, leaving the target more vulnerable. Spells can combine these effects, such as negating both armor and AD, with the necessary rolls and SP expenditures outlined in the spell’s description.

**All paths of magic share a foundational approach to their basic magical attack forms through the use of specialized bolt spells unique to each discipline. Whether it’s the Thaumaturge’s Eldritch Bolt, the Mystic’s Mystic Bolt, the Hieraticist’s Divine Bolt, or the Druid’s Nature Bolt.** 

**Each align with the thematic essence of each magical tradition, manifesting in forms that reflect their distinct elemental or divine affinities. Despite their varied appearances and specific elemental attributes, all bolt spells adhere to core mechanics, such as having a maximum range calculated by the caster’s Competence → Expertise MV multiplied by four feet and delivering potential harm based on the caster’s Expertise roll plus a predefined modifier.**

Chapter 5: Arcanum

At its basic level, possessing the Arcanum advantage grants knowledge of general magical components, rituals, and techniques. Those with such knowledge (such as adepts or mages) are called arcanists. With a spellbook, proper instruction, and careful planning, much is possible for them. Adepts are the most advanced arcanists. Their Ritual Magic feat grants the ability to create magic items, curses (hexes of obje cts and places, vodoun), potions (alchemy), and wards (sigil magic to fend off evil). At this point, adepts start to understand the higher principles of imbuing materials with arcane energy, and can do so with mastery.

Ritual Components

Components are exotic magical ingredients. They could be physical substances or items (special gemstones, mandrake root, dryad’s tears, dragon’s scale, gorgon blood, eye of newt) or more fanciful ones (a maiden’s sigh, scent of thyme, moonlight, distilled dreams, the strength of thunder). These sorts of details, as with those involved in the preparation and the rituals themselves inscribe the scroll using a cockatrice quill; walk widdershins thrice around the astrolabe in the noonday sun), are left up to the GM. 

While such details are mostly there for flavor, they could give rise to adventures from the need to find difficult to find components.

Arcane Rituals

All magic-wielders can enchant weapons and gear temporarily, as well as perform rituals to create hexes, wards, curses, and alchemical potions using arcane formulas. Adepts, as Ritual Magic, craft magical weapons, equipment, potions, and scrolls with unique expertise. Their creations are potent and long-lasting, a result of the Arcanum advantage and their proficiency in artifice and alchemy. 

When crafting, Adepts use their mastery die in ability tests, enhancing item power. They specialize in ritualizing spells for extended effects without maintenance penalties, using focus objects. Adepts gain a +2 casting roll bonus for every ten minutes of unbroken ritual casting, up to +5. 

Mages can temporarily enchant items using Arcanum but lack the innate ability to add their mastery die. If a mage acquires the Ritual Magic feat, they approach adept-level crafting. The potency of items crafted through artifice rituals is determined by an opposed roll against the arcanist's Competency → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy, reflecting a range of potency within each rarity category.

Arcanists require time and components to imbue items with magical effects and, usually, skill in handicraft or smithing (indicated by Precision or Strength respectively), to aid the ability check. Arcanists may employ expert casters and expert crafters to help them in talents they lack, working together to craft a magic item. 

An arcanist working without assistance must have basic knowledge of the kind of magic he imbues into an item. For instance, no-one lacking some proficiency in elementalism fire spells could enchant a wand to cast fireballs. The arcanist may work with other magic-wielders if he lacks knowledge of a magical path, but if so, can only benefit to the lower total of his own Expertise branch rank or that of the assisting caster. 

For instance, if they were working together to create a holy object, an arcanist with Competence d10 and a theurgist with Competence d6 would only be able to produce an effect of 2d6+2 potency for weal or woe. 

To use the Permanency Ritual for crafting enduring magic items and weaponry, arcanists (adepts) must attain a mastery level—signified by a Competence → Expertise ability branch Maximum Value of 20 or more, situating them at a minimum of high-end Level 1 or anywhere in Level 2. Mages, on the other hand, require access to this proficiency at Level 3 or beyond should they opt to acquire the corresponding feat

Item imbuement time = One hour per level of difficulty, plus an additional hour for every extra effect included in the item. 

Also, every additional incorporated, distinct effect beyond the first in a multi-effect spell (e.g., Harm + Protect) costs spirit points equal to the total MV of the challenge dice beyond the first effect. Increase zero challenge effects to a minimum of d4 for this calculation and roll the ability check at the end of imbuement time. 

Harm effects depend on the caster’s own harm potential, delivering up to the maximum dice of Competence → Expertise + Wizardry or Theurgy as indicated by the item description. 

Magic Item Use

Energy Points

Every activatable magic item has energy points, that score determined by the MV of the arcanist’s Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy branch. For instance, if an arcanist had Competence d10 → Expertise d10 → Wizardry +1, the item would have 21 infused energy points (10 + 10 + 1 for focus). 

Or for quicker determination — 8 energy points for Common items, 12 for uncommon items, 16 for Esoteric items, 20 for Occult items, and 30 for Legendary items. 

Magic Item Activation Cost

The owner of any magic item can activate it repeatedly, with the basic activation energy point cost as follows: 1 point for a single effect (including bonuses to attack or ability tests), 2 points for area effect, 3 points for a multi-effect single target, and 4 points for multi-effect multiple targets, with greater costs possible. If a user chooses to activate more than one effect at the same time, the energy costs are cumulative.

Certain magic items are designed with the capability for multiple effects, yet they can only be activated one at a time, as per the item's unique characteristics. For abilities that can be maintained over time, the requisite energy points must be expended in each round to sustain the effect.

_Special Effects_

**Defense Negation:** Items that bypass defenses exert additional energy drain due to their tactical power. If an item bypasses a target's active defense, its remaining energy points are halved. Bypassing a target's armor costs an additional 2 energy points per armor rank bypassed.

**Afflictions:** Afflictions have escalating costs based on severity. The cost is 2 energy points per potency rank of the Affliction (2, 4, 6, etc).

**Note:** If a non-permanent item's energy points reach –1 or lower, it becomes permanently inert. 

Longevity and Reuse of Magic Items

Some items are “instant,” one-time items and are instantly drained when used. Potions, and some one-shot magic scrolls and wards, are of this kind. Instant items never require energy points to activate. 

Short-term effect duration, for powers not maintained by the user, is equal to the item creator’s Competence rank in a number of battle rounds (or for random determination — 4 rounds for Common items, 6 for uncommon items (one minute), 8 for Esoteric items, 10 for Occult items, and 12 for Legendary items (two minutes)). 

If a “permanency” ritual has been cast upon an item, it can be recharged again (see the Permanency Ritual below). A user possessing the Arcanum advantage or learned in the paths of magic used in the item’s creation, may roll a Competence → Expertise ability branch check to recharge the item, starting at challenge die d2 to recharge 10%. 

**Recharge magic item**: challenge die = 1 die rank per 20% of item’s charges restored (e.g., challenge die = d10 at 80%).

Spirit Point Defense and Focus Objects

Adept and mage practitioners can use iconic focus objects to activate spirit points functioning as another temporary defense pool, whether it be a magic ring, staff, or another accouterment. Such an object is a “prop” in this case or a focus for defensive counter-spelling and need not be enchanted or specifically attuned (See Magic Defense, page 23).

Casting Unlearned Spells 

Scrolls are magical items that enable characters to cast a spell once. Using a scroll reduces Spirit Points for characters regardless of their proficiency in magic. Scrolls, along with grimoires and glyphs, are used to cast spells. Magic experts can avoid the Spirit Point cost by successfully rolling against the spell's challenge rank or the scroll's difficulty level.

Grimoires and runes differ from scrolls in that they are used for repeated access to spells, while scrolls offer a one-time magical effect. 

This distinction mirrors ancient magical practices where using a spell would remove it from a book, emphasizing the difference between temporary and permanent magical knowledge.

Casting a spell from a scroll depends on whether the caster already knows the spell. Known spells do not require Spirit Points, but unknown ones do. Those not trained in magic, especially those without the Gift of Magic advantage, find casting more challenging. Failed attempts might accumulate threat points, impacting the individual's passive defense pool, illustrating the risks of using unfamiliar magic.

Arcane and divine magic are distinct. Wizards, such as mages and adepts, use arcane energy for elemental control, while divine casters like priests and druids use divine or spiritual power linked to deities or nature. Though the sources differ, the spell manifestations may be similar. The potency of magic relies on the skill and creativity of the user rather than the source itself. The challenge rating of a Feat or magic effect determines the bonus or modification, following a scale from d4 (±1) to d12 (±5), categorizing spells by potency from common to legendary.

Permanency Ritual

Some permanent magic items such as weaponry or armor always convey their benefits when used, making them extremely valuable. Others have short-term effects activated upon command. 

Permanent items work like all others, save that they do not become useless and inert if drained below 0 energy points. Making magical things or ritual spells permanent is possible using a ritual that falls under the Competence → Expertise branch for the ability check. 

Adepts can use the permanency ritual on magic objects with imbued static bonuses (i.e., +1 to threat points, etc.), or on charged items (so that they can be recharged even if they lose all energy points), including magical traps, and wards. 

A player who seeks to have his adept or mage who has purchased this feat (an option available upon 3rd level) make an item’s regular effect permanent must consult the Permancy Ritual Difficulty table. 

The difficulty for crafting permanent magical items or traps depends on the power imbued: the highest effective MV, MV range, or modifier. 

So, a ritual spell to create a permanent magical trap with a Modify effect of 2d12 (a range of up to 24 points max value) requires an ability check rolled against a challenge of 2d12. 

The time required for a permanency ritual directly corresponds to the preparation time of the magic item or effect being made permanent. Specific crafting times for various items before applying magic are as follows:

• Sword: 1–3 days

• Ring: 5–10 hours

• Leather Armor: 3–7 days

• Mail Armor: 1–3 weeks

• Plate Armor: 1–3 months

For high-quality work, these times should be doubled, and if the item includes decorative extras like inlay and jewels, the time is doubled again. This is in additon to the general rule of one hour per level of difficulty plus extra time for additional effects.

Permanency Transference

An adept or mage can transfer the permanency bound to an item to make a maintained and active effect itself permanent, but it is costly, expending half of the item’s original energy points. For example, a caster activates his Wand of Petrifaction (Afflict effect). It unbinds the permanency from it in a crackling discharge of power that arcs to an incapacitated giant, making its stony state permanent (until dispelled). Only maintainable magic effects can be used for this, and the transfer can only be done once: the item becomes non-permanent unless another permanency ritual is cast on it.

Crafting magic items

Artificing Rituals

All crafting rituals include a challenge rating that is used as an opposed roll against the arcanist's Competency → Expertise branch + Wizardry or Theurgy, rolling against the Crafting Challenge Table (see page 160).

The rarity rating of an item created with an artifice ritual is the highest rank of all the magical effects imbued into it by the crafter, but there is a range of potency within each rarity category. Occult and legendary objects can combine a variety of effects but only masters can create such items, generally through a joint effort. 

Common types of Ritual Magic imbuements are listed below, each with one or more examples, with further listings of magic items givien in Chapter 6: Equipment.

Crafting Resonant Magic Items

Creating magic items is not merely a craft, but a profound expression of alignment between the arcane arts and the artisan's vision. This section explores the nuances of crafting magic items that resonate specifically with the wielder's abilities, amplifying their innate powers and complementing their combat styles and magical affinities.

_Resonance in Craftsmanship_ 

Resonance ensures that a magic item's effects align with the user's specific abilities and traits. This principle is key to crafting Resonant Magic Items, which are designed to enhance the wielder's natural talents and trained proficiencies. Each resonant item attunes to a single ability branch within Competence, Prowess, or Fortitude, enhancing the wielder's natural talents and trained proficiencies. These items are created by combining arcane knowledge with a deep understanding of the intended wielder's personal strengths and disciplines.

To craft a resonant magic item, artificers and enchanters must consider the desired effects and how they can best complement the user's existing skills and strategies, in addition to the usual rituals and materials..

Crafting a resonant magic item involves the usual rituals and materials, but also keen insight into the intended user's strengths. Artificers and enchanters must consider the desired effects and how they can best augment the user's existing skills and strategies. 

_Ability Item Resonances_

The following list provides examples for understanding how to tailor items to specific aspects of a character by outlining common resonances between character abilities and magic items, along with example ideas.:

**Competence** 

**Expertise → Wizardry:** Wand that increases potency of arcane spells. 

**Expertise → Theurgy:** Amulet that enhances divine healing spells. 

**Adroitness → Skulduggery:** Cloak that grants bonuses to stealth and deceit. 

**Adroitness → Cleverness:** Ring that boosts problem-solving under pressure. 

**Prowess** 

**Melee → Threat:** Sword that increases potential harm in tactical combat. 

**Melee → Finesse:** Dagger that grants bonus to initiative. 

**Precision → Ranged Threat:** Bow that improves accuracy and damage at range. 

**Precision → Ranged Finesse:** Crossbow that enhances quick loading and aiming. 

**Fortitude** 

**Strength → Ferocity:** Armor that bolsters aggression in combat. 

**Strength → Might:** Gauntlets that increase strength for heavy lifting. 

**Willpower → Courage:** Shield that provides resistance to fear effects. 

**Willpower → Resistance:** Helmet that guards against mind control spells. 

Due to their focus on arcane skills rather than fighting, adepts and arcanists rarely produce resonant magic weapons that don't match their own skillset or prowess with weaponry. However, affluent nobles, legendary fighters, and ambitious adventurers may employ an adept or arcanist to build a weapon or item around their strengths. The expensive materials, complex processes, and professional understanding make these commissioned masterpieces appealing.

Some magic items may possess multiple resonances, but only if the item's nature logically supports different functions. For example, a sword resonating with Prowess → Melee → Threat for attacks could also resonate with Competence → Expertise → Wizardry if it can cast spells like a Eldritch Bolt. However, items typically only have one resonance unless their core design allows switching between different applications backed by the item's inherent properties. 

Adepts come at a high price in such cases; priests and nobles win wars with healing amulets and magic swords. Social, political, and economic factors impact the creation and availability of things crafted for specific people and purposes. Kingdoms may forbid such things for order. Some order them for military, economic, or diplomatic reasons, but forbid the commoner, depending on the nation.

Note that an expanded list of magic items can be found in the equipment chapter (see page 180). 

Activation Imbuement 

Activation Imbuement (in the sense of causing an event or a change through an item’s magic) manifests as either a boon or a curse and covers miscellaneous spells not fitting neatly into the other categories. 

For example, spell-activated boons include all benefits like new temporary powers, divine favor, useful non-combat spells, enhanced luck, and so on. 

Curses are hexes, sometimes created with magical sigils or glyphs incorporated into the item. 

Examples of curses include Blight/Murrain and Malediction, as explained in the section under ritualized spellcasting at the end of this chapter.

**Example:** **_Ring of Sorcerous Detection_**

**Description (Activate)**: This ring detects emanations of sorcerous magic, whether of an item or the effects of a spell maintained. When activated, the ring can detect and identify magic emanations from the path of Sorcery. Activates with the expenditure of 1 to 5 energy points, if that power level is available. 

**Components**: One ring made of various precious metals, skill to make jewelry. 

**Time to Make**: Double time for the normal forging of a ring × Wizardry bonus.

**Effect**: A _common_ (d4) power level enables the wearer to identify a single magic spell affecting a single creature for 1 energy point. An _uncommon_ power level (d6) detects magic emanations if present somewhere near 2 energy points. An _esoteric_ power level (d8) detects the general direction of magic emanations (can feel if strong and if near or far). Occult power level rings (d10) grant the wearer the ability to know the precise strength and location of magic effects for 4 energy points. A _legendary_ level ring (d12) identifies a specific magic-wielder’s signature (even if that caster is unknown) for 5 energy points.

**Prerequisite:** Arcanum advantage and the skill to make jewelry. 

**Challenge:** 2d4 to 2d12

**Failure**: Ring is flawed –1 per attempted bonus, components wasted.

Affliction Imbuement

Afflict covers any of the following subeffects: Confuse, Control Mind, Debilitate Sense, Distract, Incapacitate, Knock Prone, Paralyze, Possess Spirit, Slow, Stun, and Terrorize. 

Items that cause afflictions still allow for a saving throw.

Example: _Wand of Agony_

**Description:** Inflicts pain and paralysis on a failed Valorous Saving Throw, lasting until the next round's save or the effect ends.

**Components:** Wand parts, 1000 crowns of precious metals × 13.

**Time to Make:** Twice the duration of normal weapon smithing × bonus.

**Effect:** Paralysis immobilizes the target, disabling defense points but allowing spellcasting without somatic components.

**Prerequisite:** Arcanum advantage, wandmaking skill.

**Challenge:** 2d12. 

**Failure:** Results in a flawed wand, 1 per bonus attempt, components lost.

Harm Imbuement

Harm effects are magical attacks that deliver threat points and sometimes increase the potential harm of regular attacks. Other possible advantages include bypassing armor or active defense points.

**Example:** **_Arcane Weapon (Melee)_**

**Description:** Increases a weapon's damage potential.

**Components:** Weapon parts, 1000 crowns of precious metals × bonus.

**Time to Make:** Double the normal weapon smithing time × bonus.

**Effect:** Adds +1 to weapon's potential harm per bonus.

**Prerequisite:** Arcanum advantage, weaponmaking skill.

**Challenge:** 2d4 to 2d12. 

**Failure:** results in a flawed weapon, 1 per bonus attempt, components lost.

Modification Imbuement

Modify effects either augment or curse abilities or equipment.

**Example:** **_Gloves of Strength_**

**Description:** Enhances the wearer's strength.

**Components:** 4 gems (2 per glove) worth at least 300 crowns each, leather for gloves.

**Effect:** Increases Strength specialty by 1 die rank per wearer's Prowess die rank. Only for lifting and carrying.

**Prerequisite:** Arcanum advantage, leather crafting skill.

**Challenge:** 2d6. 

**Failure:** results in nonenhancing gloves, components lost.

Protection Imbuement

Protect effects include magic shielding, armor, magical walls of protection, and various immunities.

**Example:** **_Brooch of Shielding_**

**Description:** Activates a glowing, semipermeable energy field for protection.

**Components:** Brooch with precious stones, minimum value of 1000 crowns.

**Effect:** Reduces potential harm, effective in surprise attacks. Doesn't double stack with other shields.

**Prerequisite:** A brooch (jewelry held on with a clasp or pin), round, square or in the shape of a quatrefoil, inlaid with precious stones worth at least 1000 crowns. Arcanum advantage, jeweler knowledge.

**Challenge:** 2d4 = 1 threat reduction, up to 2d12 = 5 threat reduction. 

**Failure:** Item is flawed, offers no protection, and is just a normal brooch.

Restoration Imbuement

Restore effects heal, eliminate fatigue, cure disease, revitalize the soul, and even raise the dead.

**Example:** **_Staff of Inspiritment_**

**Description:** The Staff of Inspiriting is crafted to channel divine energy, often made by theurgists, mystics, and adepts. While it requires a theurgist's prayers or a deity's blessing, it's not limited to its creator for use. The staff is capable of channeling a surge of spiritual energy, useful for restoring spirit points to the wielder or others deemed worthy by the deity involved.

**Components:** The staff is typically made from hickory, ash, or yew wood, carved with symbols of the patron deity and coated with a lacquer of resin and wax. Its creation costs 55 crowns, multiplied by its power rank (ranging from 1 to 5).

**Effect:** The staff restores spirit points, ranging from 1d4 to 1d12, based on its power level.

**Prerequisite:** The creator must have the Arcanum advantage and the skill to intricately carve the staff. The crafting process also demands the participation of a theurgist for reciting ritualistic prayers in honor of a deity associated with healing or protection. A deity's sanction is necessary for the staff to be permanently imbued with its power.

**Challenge:** Crafting the staff presents a challenge ranging from 2d4 to 2d12, dependent on the desired power level.

**Failure:** If the crafting process fails, the creator suffers a loss of spirit points equivalent to the attempted power level, ranging from 1d4 to 1d12.

**Potions (Alchemy)**

This is the specific skill of brewing drinkable potions that could have myriad effects. Simple magical effects require easy-to-obtain components, and minimal time, half an hour at least. Complex effects are possible, but components can be difficult to obtain, and brewing times can be hours, days, or more! 

The consequence of potions always mirror magic spells. Thus, the challenge die to create the potion is equal to the challenge die for the desired effect.

Magic Potion Creation

Skilled arcanists can infuse ordinary liquids with potent magical effects. Imbibing a crafted potion allows the drinker to temporarily wield spells and abilities. 

**Description:** An arcanist infuses a potion with one or more selected effects, each specifically designed to impact the imbiber directly.

**Components:** Vary with magic type and effect. Creating potion infusions usually involves a pint of strong, distilled alcohol and whatever herbs and other ingredients are listed.

**Effect:** The potion's effects directly influence the imbiber, with the specific impact depending on the chosen effects.

**Time to Brew:** Crafting a potion takes one hour per effect included in the concoction.

**Challenge:** The challenge to finalize the potion (rolled at the end of brew time) is based on the highest die rank of all included effects, doubled, as per the Crafting Challenge Table. For Adepts, the difficulty is halved.

**Magic Potion Duration**: The duration for the activated spell effects is either instantaneous (such as with Restore effects) or equals the creator's Competence rank MV in battle rounds. For a more randomized determination, durations can be:

**Common:** 4 rounds

**Uncommon:** 6 rounds

**Esoteric:** 8 rounds

**Occult:** 10 rounds

**Legendary:** 12 rounds

**Brewing Failure**: The potion is ruined, magic inert, and components wasted. If any individual spell effect has a challenge rank above d4, the alchemist suffers a backlash of psychic harm. They lose 1 spirit point for every die rank of each failed effect. For example, if a potion were to grant its imbiber greater speed at +1 (d4 challenge rank) and +2 harm to every strike (d6 challenge rank), failure to successfully imbue the brew would result in -3 spirit points as psychic harm.

**_Example: Potion of Celerity_**

**Description:** This potion quickens the movement and speed of the beneficiary, enabling incredible distance covered while sprinting or running. Grants +1 to +5 to Speed Focus.

**Brew Challenge:** 2D6 (uncommon)

**Effect Duration:** 6 rounds.

**Components:** Jackrabbit extract & ginseng

**_Potion of Healing_**

**Description:** Heals minor injuries and refreshes imbiber; 1d10 restored to passive defense and 20% to active defense.

**Brew Challenge:** 2D6 (uncommon).

**Effect Duration:** Instantaneous healing.

**Components:** The morning dew, woundwort, incense.

**_Potion of Might and Ferocity_**

**Description:** Grants +1 to +5 to Might and/or Ferocity Focus (as decided by the imbiber).

**Brew Challenge:** 2d4 up to 2d12 (common to legendary).

**Effect Duration:** 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew challenge rank.

**Components:** Ox blood, wolverine extract, and holy thistle.

**_Potion of Mystic Vision_**

**Description:** The imbiber gains some hint about impending danger or risks associated with current plans or intended actions. Like the mystic Sixth Sense spell (q.v.), the premonition comes in symbolic imagery, or sometimes interpretable visions, at the GM’s discretion. The premonition cannot extend beyond the possible consequence of the action, plan, or intention imagined. 

**Brew Challenge:** 2d8

**Effect Duration:** 8 rounds (esoteric).

**Components:** Feathers of an owl, lady’s lantle herb.

**_Potion of Observation_**

**Description:** Increases Alertness and Perspicacity focuses to a maximum of +5.

**Brew Challenge:** 2d4 up to 2d12 (common to legendary).

**Effect Duration:** 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew challenge rank.

**Components:** A blend of gotu kola, mint, and a sliver of nightshade.

**_Potion of Speed_**

**Description:** Increases speed during combat; +1 battle phase for every die rank increase in difficulty.

**Brew Challenge:** 2d4 up to d12 (common to legendary).

**Effect Duration:** 4 to 12 rounds, depending on brew challenge rank.

**Components:** Hairs from a hare’s scut, vervain, rosemary, and snake venom extract.

**_Potion of Deathdealing_**

**Description:** Whenever the imbiber rolls for potential harm, add +4 threat harm against the target's active or passive defense, and the effect bypasses all armor and shields. However, this formula is taxing and inflicts -1 spirit point for every physical attack made until the end of the effect’s duration.

**Brew Challenge:** 2d10.

**Effect Duration:** 10 rounds.

**Components:** Henbane, aconite.

Spellbooks and Scrolls 

Adepts and mages have the capability to create activatable spell scrolls or magical tomes like grimoiries. These items allow individuals, even those without a magical background or the Gift of Magic advantage, to activate spells. To trigger the predetermined magical effect, the user reads aloud from the scroll or tome, or traces occult diagrams, such as glyphs, sigils, hexagrams, and pentagrams, using their fingers or an object specifically keyed to the task. This process simplifies the casting of spells, making it accessible to a broader range of users.

However, the use of such magical items by non-magic wielders is not without risks. If the user exceeds their available spirit points while attempting to activate the spell, it can lead to a reduction in their passive defense pool. Also, there is always a risk of a potentially destructive magical backlash, which can have severe consequences.

_Unskilled Activation of Spells by means of Scroll and Grimoires_ 

Non-magic wielders attempting to cast spells from scrolls or grimoires face considerable risks. They must expend spirit points for casting; if the cost exceeds their available points, their passive defense pool is reduced. Ritual spells, which can be cast without formal magic training, are even more dangerous. A failed ritual spell triggers a backlash, doubling the usual spirit point reduction associated with casting unlearned spells. 

Glyphs & Sigils

A magic glyph is any distinct symbol drawn, inscribed, or carved into a surface that is used to activate a single magical effect. They form more complex spell formulas when used in conjunction with other glyphs.

They are found written within spellbooks, tomes of instructions for artificers, and ancient grimoires for the most mysterious and dangerous incantations. A rune is a small subset of glyphs commonly used by adepts and mages of a particular path. A sigil is any distinct sign that conveys meaning, such as the unique identification of a magic-wielder, but does not always correspond to a letter or part of a word as a rune or glyph does.

Glyphs, Wards, and Scrolls

Characters without a magic-wielding background or the Gift of Magic Advantage can attempt to cast spells found in written form, such as scrolls or grimoires, but they must spend spirit points and risk a potentially destructive backlash. If they exceed their available spirit points, it can also reduce their passive defense pool. Spells in the form of rituals can be cast without formal learning, but they carry a greater risk of self-harm.

Adepts and mages can create activatable spell scrolls or tomes, which allow the activation of spells from their pages. To activate the predetermined magic effect, the magic-wielder simply reads aloud or traces occult diagrams, such as glyphs, sigils, hexagrams, and pentagrams, using their fingers or an object key to the task.

Wards & Runes

Wards are written spells that serve a specific function, used to protect, summon, or trap. Wards are generally sigils written directly on an object, room, or, less commonly, a being. Simple wards are written, carved, or tattooed (for permanency). Creating a +1 ward vs. demons in a room would require nothing more than a way to draw the sigil. Complex wards can require components. For example, creating a ward to summon and trap a demon might require a circle of sulfur, with yew fronds at the 4 points of the compass and a powder of human bone in the center. 

**Ward inscribe time:** Challenge die in seconds (for chalk).

Thus a d6 sigil to protect against goblins would require three battle phases to draw, assuming the needed materials (explained in the ward description). Wards are often imbued with contingency effects (see Contingency Spells). Other times they are in an “always-on” state, radiating magical amity or antipathy effects (e.g., using status or modification effects). 

**Challenge:** Challenge to activate ward (rolled at the end of drawing time) is based on the highest die rank of all included effects, doubled, as per the Crafting Challenge Table. 

Wards can be broken by a Dispel Effect spell, opposing the target ward’s challenge die. (If cast as a ritual, Dispel Effect always has a challenge die equal to the force being dispelled, takes an amount of time equal to the original ritual to complete, and can dismiss any magical status effect.) 

Dispelling the magic of any actively maintained spell requires one battle phase in a round, but failing the attempt imposes a penalty matching the targeted effect’s challenge die on the Spell Failure Table.

**_Ward of Minor Protection_**

**Description:** Grants the owner or renter of a domicile magical protection within its walls.

**Components:** A method to draw the word.

**Target:** One room.

**Effect:** +1 damage reduction off the top of any harm that might befall the beneficiary; also adds +1 to any defense rolls vs. magical opposed rolls.

**Challenge:** 2d8.

**Failure:** The ward offers no protection.

**_Demon Trap_**

**Description:** A circle through which a demon can enter but not leave. 

**Components:** Simply a way to draw the ward circle. 

**Target:** One area, generally 4 feet in diameter. 

**Effect:** Demons cannot exit the trap until the circle is broken, and the trapped demon is forbidden to break the circle without a saving throw versus the trap’s challenge die. A successful saving throw allows the demon to break the circle in the next round, or 10 seconds. 

**Challenge:** 2d6 to 2d12+ (the challenge die to set the trap equals the challenge die for a demon to break free). 

Failure: Ward offers no protection. You don’t want to find that out too late! 

**_Attunement Sigil (adept class only]_**

**Description:** An inscribed or painted symbol that attunes the object to the caster. 

**Components:** Simply a way to draw, engrave, or burn in the sigil (the ‘Conjurer’s Seal’). 

**Target:** One object or creature (such as a dagger or a steed). 

**Effect:** Attuned objects may be called to a conjurer’s hand with a common teleportation spell. 

**Challenge:** 1d4 (or zero if not in combat, given enough time). 

**Failure:** The sigil may be correct, but the attunement fizzled..

**_Explosive Book Ward_**

**Example:** Explosive Book Ward

**Description:** A magical rune on the book’s cover causes a 5' radius fireball to detonate any time the book is opened unless the correct password is spoken. 

**Components:** Ink incorporating powdered dragon scale for the rune. 

**Target:** One book. 

**Effect:** A 5' radius fireball explodes if the book is opened, doing 12+d6 potential harm. 

**Challenge:** 12+d6. 

**Failure:** The book ward either fizzles or destroys the book in the explosion (unless it is protected against fire). 

Spell Ritualization 

Adepts and mages can perform rituals to cast non-instantaneous spells without maintenance penalties, but they need a focus object that must remain intact during the intended duration. Focus objects must include magical components suited to the intended use. Ritual time equals the desired duration, so a one-hour ritual summons a demon for one hour. Adepts gain a +2 bonus to their casting roll for every unbroken ten minutes spent in ritual casting, with a maximum bonus of +5. 

Ritualized spells use the same rules as normal spells, but instantaneous spells cannot be ritualized. 

**Breaking the focus object:** a Competence → Expertise branch roll opposing the spell’s challenge die, or a failed Fortitude → Willpower save by the caster during a renewal ritual can break the active spell. If the caster fails the Willpower save, all maintained magical powers fizzle, including the ritual. Other ritual spells within duration remain unaffected as long as their focus objects are safe. 

Hexes and Curses

Curse Ritual

Curse rituals involve the creation of a focus object central to casting curses designed to prolong their duration while avoiding maintenance penalties for the caster. These spells require specific components to target the victim, and knowledge in this area includes understanding how to break curses. The curse creation time is equivalent to the challenge die in minutes. For instance, a d6 curse designed to attract the undead would take six minutes to cast, provided the necessary materials are on hand. 

The challenge to finalize a focus object, such as a mystical totem, cursed scroll or amulet, hexed crystal, or stone, is determined by the highest challenge die of all its effects.

**Examples**:

**_Blight/Murrain_**

**Description:** Causes disease in cultivated plants or farm animals. Components for the curse might include a hex bag with —uncommon— herbs, mummy dust, etc., to be buried in the field or among the herd.

**Effect:** Leads to withering or sickening and can be fatal to the extent desired.

**Challenge:** d2 per 10% of the crop or herd to be affected (e.g., a d10 for 50%).

**Failure:** If the soil rejects the hex bag, there is no effect. If discovered and taken to a knowledgeable adept or mage, the caster might be identified or become subjected to their own hex.

**_Malediction_**

**Description:** Curses whoever touches the maledicted totem, making it impossible to dispose of.

**Components:** Any object, often a trinket or minor treasure, and ethereal glue.

**Target:** The first intelligent, living creature to touch the object. The handler suffers a penalty to ability tests, and the item persistently reappears.

**Challenge:** d6 per –1 to the victim's ability tests.

**Failure:** If the object is not cursed, the arcanist must pass an ability check against the original challenge die to be certain.

Iconic Arcane Inheritance

This advantage grants characters a unique magical item or weapon imbued with inherent magic, either inherited or discovered during a pivotal moment. This advantage costs 4 character points during character creation. The item's inherent magic can only be dispelled by legendary means.

Initial Character Creation

**Choosing an Item:** Select an item or weapon resonating with one of the character's abilities. This choice could be a family heirloom or a unique creation commissioned by a wealthy patron. Players are encouraged to develop a visual and narrative description for their Iconic Arcane Inheritance items, emphasizing their unique history and significance. 

**Iconic Magic Items Energy Points:** Players may choose a Unified Iconic Item, an artifact combining a weapon and an Inspirational Focus. These items are considered rare and possess a pool of energy points equal to the primary resonant ability branch, a pool which increases along with each MV tier of that branch; average 4 ep, respectable 6 ep, skilled 12 ep, great 18 ep, and phenomenal 24 ep.

**Magic Properties:** All Iconic Items start with one magic property. Unified Iconic Items start with two magic properties: one weapon-related function and one Inspirational Focus function. Each function has a resonance with an ability branch that determines the item’s energy points, increasing with branch rank rather than character level 

**Examples of Magic Properties:**

**Weapon Functions (Harm):**

**Enhanced Potential Harm:**+1 to +5 to potential harm rolls.

**Elemental Infusion:** +1 threat point of chosen elemental damage per hit.

**Special Attacks:** Disarm, trip, or other unique effects.

**Defensive Bonuses:** +1 to Armor.

Inspirational Focus Functions (Activate, Modify, or Protect):

**Skill Bonuses:** +1 to +5 to relevant Ability tests.

**Enhanced Perception:** Darkvision, tremorsense.

**Mental Resistance:** +1 to saving throws against fear or other effects.

**Minor Spellcasting:** Light, Guidance, or similar spells.

**Resonance:** All magic properties must resonate with the character's ability branch (Competence, Prowess, or Fortitude). Unified Iconic Items resonate with two branches: one for the Weapon Function and one for the Inspirational Focus function.

**Example:** A sword with Prowess → Melee could gain an increased critical hit chance, while an item with Competence → Expertise → Wizardry could reduce spellcasting costs. (Note: This example is not explicitly from the provided sources and may require independent verification.)

Awaken Iconic Powers 

Narrative milestones, determined by the game master, can trigger the discovery of new magical properties within the Iconic Item. 

**Unlocking New Powers:** Characters spend Character Points (CP) to awaken new powers. The CP cost for a new property should vary based on its power and rarity, using existing magic item creation guidelines for reference.

**Enhancing Existing Powers:** Characters can also spend CP to increase the potency of existing effects. For example, an item granting a +1 bonus to a specific skill could be enhanced to provide a +2 bonus. (Note: This example is not explicitly found in the provided sources and may require independent verification.) 

Item Activation and Spirit Points

**Activation Mechanics:** Iconic Arcane Inheritance effect potency is capped by the character's level and uses per day by their total mastery die uses per day. The exact activation method for each power (free action, bonus action, etc.) should be clearly defined for each property. Spirit Points (Unified Iconic Items Only): Activating magical abilities tied to specific Magic Effects that involve rolling a die (as opposed to static bonuses, which) can cost spirit points, with the cost varying depending on the power and complexity of the effect. First-level characters are limited to rare items with a maximum of two magic properties. Iconic Inspirational Items grant the ability to replenish spirit points for their Unified Iconic Item by spending energy points as described in source for "Recharge".)

**Item Loss**

**Retrieval:** It could involve a quest or challenge, with the difficulty scaling to the item's rarity and power. 

**Replacement:** Allowing characters to find or create a new Iconic Item, but at a significant cost (experience points, rare materials, etc.). 

**Narrative Consequence:** The loss could have story implications, weakening the character or forcing them to adapt. 

Chapter 6: EquipmentStage Properties 

'_All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players_' - William Shakespeare.

The stage of an RPG is as limitless as the collective visual imagining of its players, including its Game Master. In the analogy of a play, the stage properties, or “props,” are items carried, interacted with, or used by characters, NPCs, or monsters within a game session’s scenes. Props include weapons, armor, magic items, and treasure. Special props have designators that illustrate their special use, for example, an iconic weapon or magic focus and various damage types associated with each weapon. 

Weapons List

In Eldritch RPG, a character's abilities and personal style take center stage, making a knife as deadly as a sword. While medium and large melee weapons have a minimum damage die rank (d6 and d8 respectively), it's the adventurer's unique skills and style that truly set weapons apart.

Threat Point Bonuses

Focus areas like Threat or Ranged Threat boost attacks by adding threat points. Threat is linked to the Melee specialty under Prowess, while Ranged Threat is tied to the Precision specialty. 

**Iconic Weapons** are unique weapons with a damage type (Crushing, Slashing, or Impaling) that gives extra threat points if the character has the matching focus: _Might_ for Crushing, _Ferocity_ for Slashing, or _Speed_ for Impaling. 

Additionally, when expending a mastery die with an Iconic Weapon, you gain +1 threat point per character level and might trigger the “master twist” effect (see page 179).

Weapon statistics are written as follows: Weapon Name - Size / Reach - Damage Type.

For example, a warhammer would be listed as: **Warhammer** - Large / Short - Crushing. Unarmed attacks do not list weapon size but generally assume Small for Medium-sized creatures.

**_Natural Attacks_**

For all player characters, “melee weapons” can include punches, kicks, fangs, and strikes. These are labeled as “natural attacks” in monster listings, but the term “weapon” is used in the same way that unarmed strikers refer to their knees, elbows, fists, and feet.Bludgeoning Weapons

**• Club** - Small / Short -Crushing

**• Warhammer** - Large / Short - Crushing

**• Spear** (thrown) - Ranged (10/30/50) - Impaling

**• Throwing** **Axe** - Ranged (10/30/50) - Slashing

Basic Weapon Damage Types

When attacking with a weapon, characters can add focus bonuses to their potential harm (Threat Points) based on their specialization and the weapon's damage type.

_Specialist Bonus_

Characters with specialization in Melee (for hand-to-hand combat) or Precision (for ranged combat) add their relevant focus bonus to potential harm:

• Melee specialists add their**Threat** focus bonus

• Precision specialists add their**Ranged** **Threat** focus bonus

_Maximizing Combat Potential_

All melee weapons, regardless of damage type (crushing, slashing, or impaling), utilize the _threat_ (melee) focus bonus, enabling characters with higher threat to inflict more damage through tactical positioning and exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. Similarly, ranged weapons leverage the _ranged threat_ (precision) focus bonus to enhance attacks with bows, crossbows, or thrown weapons.

Iconic Weapons possess unique properties and synergize with their damage types, enhancing both melee and ranged combat. For example, an iconic crushing melee weapon gains bonuses from both threat (melee) and _might_, channeling raw strength into powerful blows, while an iconic slingshot benefits from ranged threat (precision) and _might_, increasing damage and accuracy. Additionally, an iconic impaling ranged weapon gains bonuses from ranged threat (precision) and either _speed_ or _skullduggery_, improving precision and shot accuracy for rogues. When a character expends a mastery die while attacking with an Iconic Weapon, they receive the iconic weapon bonus (+1 threat point per character level) and may trigger the _master twist_ mechanic by rolling a 1, allowing a re-roll to potentially transform a weak attack into a devastating blow.Armor and Shields

Armor reduces threat points that exceed the defender’s defense points by a die roll depending on the armor type. 

Shields reduce threat points by 1 to 3 points per shield type above before active defense points are reduced. The active DP must be above zero, or the wielder is too tired to use the shield to block effectively. 

Magic and Natural Armor Types

Magic armor increases die-rank or grants a static bonus (this bonus can be bypassed). Creatures with natural armor (scales, tough hide) wearing additional armor, or humanoids wearing multiple armor roll types the highest die rank of armor types, then add +1 per die rank for the secondary armor.

• **Esoteric** / **Preternatural**: + 1-2 damage reduction added to armor roll. Other magic Effects could be imbued (see Arcanum section).

• **Legendary** / **Supernatural**: + 3-4 damage reduction added to armor roll. Other magic Effects could be imbued (see Arcanum section).

Magic shield types add a static bonus (e.g., small +1 shield reduces threat points by 2). 

Shields reduce threat points as part of a defender’s overall efforts—deflection, parrying, or aiding evasive maneuvers—while armor absorbs remaining threat points with a random roll, reflecting both its protective strength and the attacker’s chance to exploit weaknesses, with excess affecting passive defense.Iconic Props

Iconic Props represent special items deeply connected to a character. From weapons to spell foci to cherished mementos, they empower various actions. Every character may possess an Iconic item, starting with one at Level One and optionally adding another at every level of advancement. Such an item can be a weapon, a spellcasting focus (designated as a Magic Foci), or any item of significance (sentimental, heirloom) that grants a bonus to some ability or action. 

These signature props not only add greater variety and color to the character, but also provide a way for players to showcase their character's individual talents and skills. These items often enhance attack power, spellcasting precision, or aid in ability tests. 

Attacks with Iconic Props

When a character launches an attack using an Iconic Weapon or Iconic Magical Foci object, they receive an additional focus bonus to their potential harm roll. This bonus corresponds to the designated damage type of the weapon used or speccific magic item properties. This extra focus bonus accumulates with other bonuses and applies regardless of whether the attack is close or ranged. 

**• Iconic Battle Spell Foci:** Magic Harm includes any harm or injury inflicted by magic, such as fire, ice, lightning, and psychic effects. When wielding an Iconic Magical Battle Foci to channel harmful spells, the wielder adds their vitality focus bonus to the potential harm of the attack roll. Vitality represents the life energy that enhances magical power when used as a weapon.

**Iconic Attack Potential Harm Calculation:** Potential harm is derived from a character’s ability branch and focus areas, rather than strictly from weapon properties. Iconic weapons or battle foci enhance combat or spellcasting by adding a second focus area bonus to threat points. For example, an iconic metal sword’s harm adds ferocity (for slashing) in addition to the standard threat (melee) bonus if specialized in melee, while a magic user’s damaging spell combines wizardry and vitality (for iconic magic harm).

**Example:**

Matilda, a 1st-level warrior, strikes with her iconic warhammer. Her melee skill adds threat (melee) +2, and her strength adds might +4. Additionally, she channels her energy with her iconic weapon bonus (+1) (using a mstery die), resulting in a total potential harm of +7 (Threat +2 + Might +4 + Iconic Weapon Bonus +1).

Master Twist

If the mastery die rolls a 1, the Master Twist effect is triggered. This allows the player to re-roll the mastery die and add the new result to their total threat points, potentially transforming a weak attack into a devastating blow. The Master Twist reflects the weapon’s enhanced properties, whether magical or nonmagical, stemming from its significance to the character. 

Iconic Magic Foci

Mages, mystics, and theurgists use magical foci as catalysts for channeling and condensing magical currents. There are two types of Magic Foci; Battle and Inspirational. Both kinds are usually wands, staves or holy symbols attuned to the caster. 

**Battle Foci**: When used as a weapon in close combat, such items can increase the strength of Harm spells by amplifying the intensity of damaging energy to a critical level. 

**Magic** **Style**: A spell foci item; wands, holy symbols channeling harm spells, or activated magic items. Uses Competence → Expertise. For Mystics, this is optionally Fortitude → Willpower. Attackers using magical, Iconic Foci may swap Spellcraft or Theurgy focuses for Speed or Reaction when determining potential harm.

**Inspirational Foci:** Inspirational Foci are items with sentimental or historical significance that enhance a character's abilities in non-combative scenarios, particularly in activating non-harmful spells or ability tests. These items must be held or visible to be effective. While wielding such an item, characters gain a +1 bonus per level to skill checks involving abilities from the designated Branch (Competence, Prowess, or Fortitude), enhancing awareness or focus. The branches and their corresponding specialties are:

**Competence** → Adroitness, Expertise, or Perception.

**Prowess** → Agility, Melee, or Precision.

**Fortitude** → Endurance, Strength, or Willpower.

These Foci can be varied, such as jewelry, lucky charms, or other items, but cannot be used for feats or attack actions, only for non-harming spells during battle. The mastery die is applicable to specific Ability Branches during ability tests.

Swapping Iconic Items

Characters may change which item they designate as their iconic weapon, spell focus, or inspiring object (which can also be a spell focus) once per level, or more often if allowed by the GM.

For example, a halfling rogue may designate their lucky rabbit foot as their inspiring object for Competence → Adroitness rolls, allowing them to add their mastery die and potentially achieve a critical success once per level per day. 

Mastery Die and Twists

To summarize, the mastery die—scaling with a character’s level—can be added to an attack or ability test involving an iconic prop. It is usable once per encounter or challenging situation, up to the character’s daily limit per level. When the mastery die rolls a 1, the _Master Twist_ effect is activated, allowing a second roll of the die. 

The new result is added to threat points for weapons and battle foci or boosts the success of ability tests for other iconic props. Master Twist represents a twist of fate brought about by the character’s mastery, enabling them to fully harness the power of their iconic props in critical moments. This effect can only be activated once per use of the mastery die, whether using the normal or an alternate style branc. 

Magic Items

The following magic items are detailed in order of type and then rarity. The magic effect of each is also listed, in addition to the general description. 

**Magic item effect duration:** The short-term effect of a magic item lasts as long as the creator's competence rank in battle rounds, or the following defaults are used—4 rounds for Common items, 6 rounds for Uncommon items (1 minute), 8 rounds for Esoteric items, 10 rounds for Occult items, and 12 rounds for Legendary items (2 minutes).

**Default energy points:** The default number of energy points for magic items is based on how rare they are — 8 energy points for Common items, 12 energy points for Uncommon items, 16 energy points for Esoteric items, 20 energy points for Occult items, and 30 energy points for Legendary items. 

Some items are specific, named ones created and recognized by a particular fantasy species. In contrast, others are more general, like “preternatural weapon,” and serve as a template for more variance in their types. 

Artifacts 

Items created with the permanence ritual or made permanent through such means are considered artifacts of two types: **perpetual** and **bounded** (See Arcanum Chapter). 

Perpetual artifacts’ magic effects are “always on” and do not require activation. 

Bounded artifacts require activation and will work a number of times per day equal to the owner’s character level. Artifacts are inherently uncommon and are thus listed by potency rank rather than by the usual rarity. E.g., Artifact 1 through Artifact 5.

As described under equipment, we can assign dollar amounts to items in the game world that would be comparable to things in our world (bread and ale as is, horse and cart or chariot for a car, etc.). With magic items, that is trickier. The base price for the item should be the same as a sword (comparable to a rifle, say $500 to $1000). Suggested price increase is a multiplier based on highest die-rank of a magic item’s effect. For example a Wand of Affliction with a d12 Incapacitation effect would cost ×5 in $.

Discoverable Magic

Casting Unlearnt Spells

In the realm of discoverable magic, learning new spells can be achieved through various methods, applicable to both divine and arcane spells. A character may learn a new spell by discovering a grimoire or spellbook, delving into the secrets it holds. 

Those with the Gift of Magic have the opportunity to learn spells from companions, allies, or any willing individual, provided they share the same character class or meet other specific prerequisites set forth by the Game Master. 

This process of learning spells is distinct from regular spellcasting, which assumes that the caster has thoroughly learned the magical formula, diligently written it in their spellbook, memorized the ritual, and integrated it into their magical repertoire. 

Beyond these traditional methods, a character can also cast a spell by directly reading it from a page, uttering a word of power from a glyph, or through other means of activation. While this approach offers the flexibility of casting unlearnt spells, it is inherently more challenging, spiritually taxing, and carries a heightened risk, particularly for those attempting to wield magic beyond their current mastery. This risk is even more pronounced when activating an unlearnt spell, as it demands a deeper, more intuitive connection with the magical forces at play, often leading to unpredictable outcomes. 

Spirit Points Cost

Casting any unlearnt magic spell, whether from a scroll, grimoire, glyph, or meticulously learned imitation, costs spirit points equal to the MV of the spell rank (Common spells; d4 costs 4 spirit points. Uncommon spells; d6, costs 6 spirit points, and so on). If the cost exceeds available spirit points, then the residual cost reduces passive defense points directly! Desperate magic-wielders have been known to nearly destroy themselves trying to launch one final spell to win the day.

Magic Defense & Mastery

**Cognitive saving throw:** Competence → Perception → Alertness/Perspicacity or Competence → Expertise → Wizardry/Theurgy, saving against mental manipulations.

**Skillful saving throw:** Prowess → Agility → Speed/Reaction or Prowess → Melee → Threat/Finesse, evading threats using agility and combat skills. The Skillful saving throw complements the defensive measures and harm system, defending against afflictions when active defense hit points can't be used.

**Valorous saving throw:** Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance/Vitality or Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience/Courage, resisting effects demanding fortitude..

Magic Defense

Magic Defense is a powerful ability for Tier 2 magic-wielders with the Gift of Magic advantage. It shields against non-physical magical harm by utilizing their active defense ht points pool. However, it does not protect against magical effects requiring a saving throw (see page 235). For more details on Tier 2 and its benefits, refer to Gift of Magic in the advantage section (page 23)

Mastery and Twists of Fate

The mastery die represents a character's exceptional skills and grows in power as the character gains levels. This special die can be added to various checks, rolls, and damage, enhancing the character's performance in their areas of expertise.

The size of the mastery die is determined by the character's level, starting at a d4 for levels 1-4 and increasing in size as the character progresses through the tiers of play.

When using iconic items and weapons, or mastery path spells, characters can benefit from the "master twist" mechanic. In these cases, if the mastery die roll results in the minimum value for that die size (e.g., a 1 on a d4), the character can roll the die again and add the new result to the total. This represents a twist of fate brought about by the character's mastery, allowing them to turn even the most challenging situations to their advantage when wielding these special items.

Characters can spend spirit points to gain extra mastery die rolls, with the number of daily uses increasing as they gain levels.

**_Note for the Game Master: Spears and Polearms_**

Engaging in a sword fight on a battlefield may sound glorious, but it’s not so great when your opponent throws a spear at you. In all cultures, spears were more effective than swords in battle. This helped keep foot soldiers safe when fighting hand-to-hand. 

Fighters often use a thrusting motion rather than swinging polearms, which are similar to spears. The main differences are the tips of the weapons, which can include a hammer, an axe, or a longer blade (such as found on a voulge or a naginata). 

Halberds are an exception to this rule, as they are shorter in length and allow the warrior to swing the deadly axe blade. However, most polearms were placed on the ground with the hammer or axe section ready to be used to unhorse or impale mounted knights, particularly when the knights were at a standstill. 

If you are a seasoned Game Master, you already know what to do. Put together compelling adventures with a good mix of exploration, interaction, combat, puzzles, tricks, and traps; know the rules well enough that players don’t need to; referee the game fairly while taking on the roles of all men and monsters other than the PCs and describing scenes and results of actions as they occur in response to players' statements. Players control their characters; you control everything else and collaborate in creating the story of their exploits. Simple. 

If you are a novice, do not worry; it gets easier with experience. You can learn along with your players. There is plenty of advice on Game Mastering, but the essentials are simple. Understand the game rules and apply them impartially. Prepare for the adventure but be ready to improvise because your players surely will. Keep the game moving and the players involved with brief, colorful descriptions and interactions. Always let characters have choices and fair chances to succeed and encourage and reward good play.

Character Advancement

Eldritch RPG measures character experience using character points awarded for the group and individual achievement and story milestones. After character creation is completed, character points (CPs) reset to zero. Characters typically then earn between 1 and 4 points per session. This is for showing up (1 CP), participating (1 CP), and up to 2 bonus points for entertaining and intelligent play during the session (see individual bonus points below). The rules assume an average of four to ten points per session, increased through exceptional play.

Session Rewards 

As a Game Master for the Eldritch Role Playing Game, you can use the following rewards to incentivize your players and encourage creative and engaging gameplay.

Group Bonus Points

**Surviving a devastating battle:** Award 4 CPs to player characters who survive the battle, even if they are carried away unconscious. If they are later resurrected by their friends, they retroactively earn the group bonus.

**Overcoming dangerous situations:** Award 2 CPs to each character involved in overcoming a precarious situation.

Individual Bonus Points

**Singular action award:** Award 4 CPs to a character who wins an encounter with a unique idea or impulse.

**Creative play award:** Award 2 CPs for entertaining role-playing, clever spell improvisations, or engaging combat narratives.

**Role assumption award:** Award 2 CPs if a player takes a risk in the game by being true to his or her character’s concept, as long as it doesn’t harm the group.

Repute and Negotiation Rewards

If your player characters hinder a threat or turn an enemy into an ally, you can award them the following character points based on the difficulty of the potential threat:

**• Minor:** 2 CPs

**• Standard:** 4 CPs

**• Exceptional:** 6 CPs

**• Legendary:** 8-10 CPs

This reward is only granted if the characters successfully negotiate with the enemy, significantly affecting the story's outcome. It does not apply if the enemy is defeated or assassinated without any attempt at negotiation..

Keep in mind that a character's reputation can vary between different societies and time periods in your fantasy world, and may sometimes reflect infamy rather than prestige. 

Narrative Milestones 

Completing a scene or story arc: Whenever your adventurers reach the end of a major scene or story arc, consider awarding additional points to recognize their progress and accomplishments. Typically, this is around 10 CPs for each participant.

Heroic Action

Once the GM rolls the challenge die or dice, the player makes a test roll and the results are compared. If the player’s roll is equal to or greater than the GM’s roll, the character succeeds (in a contest of skill, the defender wins a tie). 

The difficulty levels of situational challenge and their corresponding die or dice are shown in the Ability Test Table. 

Easy is the lowest rating a challenge may have. If the GM determines the challenge is less taxing than that, the character automatically succeeds in the attempt. Likewise, no challenge is more difficult than Formidable—the only way to describe a task more daunting is to call it impossible.

Occasionally, owing to extraordinary circumstances, aptitudes, and spells, the GM may roll additional opposing dice (“with disadvantage” on the table) or modify the roll by –5 to +5.

Hazards

Collision (falls, boulders, etc.)

Falling causes damage equal to 10 hit points for every 10 feet fallen, with Fortitude the only Defense. For objects falling onto a living creature, the GM should assign 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, depending on size and weight (small, medium, large, huge, gargantuan, respectively), see also Chapter 4, Hazards of Magic (Conjuration, Summon Object). 

Objects slamming into a living creature, modified by velocity and circumstance; usually, the damage will be similar. Do not bother with complex formulas for this. The GM may allow active defense points to apply against most of these types of harm before depleting Fortitude. f a hero is out of active DP, the GM may allow a saving throw instead. Roll Fortitude → Willpower vs. the amount of Potential Harm:the difference in rolls is applied to Fortitude (covering all physical or critical damage to body, mind, and spirit).

Weather (heat, cold, etc.) 

Bad weather conditions can create situations causing penalties to ability tests while extreme weather can directly damage creatures' active defense score. The GM may assign random damage per round, as with terrible heat or cold, or a flat number of damage points for situations like lightning strikes or hailstorms. The range is usually anywhere from 4 to 3d12 (1 point to 36 points).

Toxins and Diseases 

Toxins and diseases (venom, poison, plague, pox, etc.) are generally assigned a challenge die from Easy d4 to Formidable d12. The GM also decides how they take effect and what effect they have. Toxins or diseases must penetrate the target’s defense points if delivered by physical attacks, such as a striking snake or poisoned sword tip. However, if a disease is introduced to the host, it only takes hold if a Fortitude → Willpower check against it is failed. 

Some poisons can be similarly resisted, though others are more potent, with the difference in rolls being applied as damage to the passive defense (or to a specific Ability, depending on the nature of the poison). This could occur all at once, per period of exposure, etc. Other toxins or diseases could, for example, apply a –1 per die rank penalty to ability tests or cause the equivalent of magical effects (e.g., immobilization).

Traps

Traps in Eldritch RPG are essential elements that add challenge and unpredictability to the game. They are designed to have damaging, debilitating, or immobilizing effects, are typically sprung under specific circumstances, and often catch their targets unawares. Traps can be categorized based on type, detection and disarming difficulty, effect, defenses against them, their area of effect, and a general description.

Table of Hazard Levels in Eldritch RPG

Detection / Disarm Difficulty

Description Indicates the challenge involved in both detecting and disarming traps. _Note that challenge in detecting a trap may not coorespond to the difficulty in disarming the same trap_. 

**Mechanics:** Uses a two-dice system (e.g., 2d6, 2d8) rather than a single die, providing a broader range of difficulty and a higher average result. The first value represents the detect challenge, and the second value represents the disarm challenge.

Higher dice values (e.g., 2d10, 2d12) indicate more complex or well-hidden traps, requiring greater skill or perception to detect and disarm.

**Effect:** Measures the potential harm or impact of the trap, including physical damage, magical effects, or other detrimental outcomes. Expressed in threat points, indicating the severity of the trap's effects. This could be direct damage (e.g., 2d10 threat points) or other effects like curses or debuffs. Higher threat points reflect more dangerous traps that can inflict severe damage or have potent effects.

Interacting with Traps

The outcome of a detect roll determines the information gained about the trap. A basic success might only reveal its presence, while a more impressive success could disclose its function, trigger mechanism, or both. Detection before activation allows for potential disarming. The disarm difficulty is assigned based on a challenge die, usually ranging from 1d4 up to 2d12. Failing to disarm a trap may trigger it, contingent on the trap's nature and the severity of the failure, at the Game Master's discretion.

Mechanical Traps

Mechanical traps are usually meant to cause harm through a physical attack, represented as threat points, and so can be avoided by using defense points. Depending on the trap and the situation, you may be able to use both active and passive defenses. They can have effects other than causing potential harm, such as poison (see Hazards, above). 

A character searching an area for mechanical traps rolls a check using Competence → Perception → Alertness against the trap’s _detect challenge_ die (d4 through 2d12). A character attempting to disarm a trap rolls against the trap’s _disarm_ challenge die using Competence → Adroitness → Skulduggery. 

Magical Traps

Magical traps can cause almost any magical spell effect, so potential defenses vary. The traps are active until triggered or dispelled. Magical traps follow the same rules as any other magic item; they have internal energy points and become inert when those points are spent unless recharged or made permanent with a permanency ritual. Magical traps are often invisible, but they leave signs that magically trained characters can detect, such as a mystic rune inscribed on a door, a slightly odd lighting effect, or an itch affecting the skin. 

A magic-using character can detect magical traps using Competence → Perception + Wizardry or Theurgy (using the twisted branch rule) against the trap’s detect challenge die (d4 through 2d12). The same ability branch can be used to roll against the trap’s disarm challenge die to attempt to disarm it. A character who is not magically trained who uses Competence → Perception → Alertness to detect traps may detect the existence of a magical trap on an exceptional roll, but that’s all. 

Creating Traps

Some traps are very old and it can be hard to figure out where they came from. These include the ancient sorceries that guard the cobwebbed tombs of mystic warriors, the stonework in abandoned dwarven deeps, and the simple but deadly traps of greedy, primitive, and often violent humanoids. 

Most traps are more contemporary, set in place by NPCs or groups of intelligent creatures to protect themselves or their treasure vaults, or to sequester and prevent the return of their abducted prisoners, and so on. 

Player characters can also make traps. Mechanical traps are constructed using whatever relevant ability branches a character has available, assuming sufficient resources and time. To create a magical trap, an adept must create a trap ritual using ritual, Competence, Expertise, and Wizardry (or Theurgy for traps powered by divine magic). Magical traps are constructed similarly to any other magic item but a specific ritual can only create a specific trap. Whether a PC can build a particular trap, and the details thereof, are left to the GM’s discretion.

Trap Descriptions

All traps use the following format: Name, Type, Detect/Disarm, Effect, Defenses, Area, Description. The name simply identifies the trap. 

**Type:** Traps can be either mechanical or magical. Mechanical traps are made by and take effect through mundane means. Magical traps are created by and use arcane effects. 

**Detect/Disarm:** Uncovering a trap is the first hurdle. Each trap's detection difficulty is represented by a challenge die, or sometimes multiple dice, ranging from a humble d4 to a daunting 2d12. The more dice rolled, and the higher their potential results, the tougher it will be to spot the hidden danger. But detection is only half the problem. Once you know a trap is there, another challenge roll – with potentially different dice for the challenge – determines how tricky it is to disarm. So beware; just because a trap was simple to find doesn't guarantee it'll be easy to disable, and vice-versa!

**Effect:** This entry specifies the immediate or prolonged consequences triggered by a trap. For traps that inflict continuous harm, the duration of the effect is linked to the trap's "Trap Level." The effect persists for a number of rounds equal to the Trap Level. For instance, a trap with a Trap Level of 1 will have its effect last for one round, while a trap with a Trap Level of 3 will continue its effect for three rounds. 

**Defenses:** The nature of a trap’s effect may mean that certain defenses (e.g., armor or active DP) afford no protection against it, so those that are effective are noted here.

**Area:** What is affected when the trap is triggered. It can be a single creature, an area of effect, or something else entirely. 

**Description:** This describes the trap in general and other important details, such as whether the trap can be reset, if the reset is automatic or manual, if energy points are used for magic, etc. 

Trap Listing

Acidic Floor

**Type:** Mechanical

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d6 / 1d8

**Effect:** Acid damage; 2d8 threat points per round

**Defenses:** Active DP, Armor

**Area:** Entire floor or designated area 

**Description:** The floor appears normal but is secretly coated with corrosive acid. When triggered, the acid eats away at anything in contact, causing 2d8 threat points of damage per round. Characters must rely on Active DP and armor to mitigate the acid’s effects. The trap does not reset until the acid is neutralized. 

Bear Trap 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d4 / 2d4 

**Effect:** 3d10 threat points 

**Defenses:** Armor, Active DP 

**Area:** One creature 

**Description:** Concealed under a pile of dead leaves or other loose material is a set of iron jaws that snap shut on the leg of a creature stepping into it. The bear trap can be manually reset. 

The Brick 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d6 / 1d8 

**Effect:** 2d10 threat points 

**Defenses:** Active DP 

**Area:** One creature

**Description:** Inset in a wall is a series of gems at roughly the height of a human, dwarf, elf, gnome, etc. The gems seem valuable and cannot be pried out. If a lone brick that sticks halfway out of the bottom of the wall is pushed, a stone dowel will launch from the wall behind the prospective gem collector and strike them with significant force. The “gems” that then clatter to the floor will be found to be near worthless. The trap does not reset. 

Death Scroll 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 1d4 / 2d10 

**Effect:** Maintained threat points, 12+d6 (13–18) per round 

**Defenses:** Fortitude 

**Area:** Creature reading scroll 

**Description:** A dusty old scroll, rolled up with a magic seal, placed just where some unsuspecting or naive adventurer will inevitability pick it up and regret it. The act of reading it triggers the effect. 

Electric Room 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d12 / 2d10 

**Effect:** 3d10 electricity threat points 

**Defenses:** Fortitude DP 

**Area:** One creature

**Description:** A ritual was performed to electrify the room’s walls, as well as any closed doors, and made permanent (Energy points: 30 pool / 5 points per triggering). The effect can be detected if the low electric hum is heard. Otherwise, the field is invisible. Anybody touching a vertical surface will be shocked for 3d10 threat points. Metal walls increase damage by ×1.5. 

Enfeeblement Trap 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 1d10 / 1d8 Effect: Modify 

**Defenses:** Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance

**Area:** Archway 

**Description:** Blue light fills the archway when someone passes through it, and that person is affected by a Modify effect that drains the Strength specialty and all Melee attacks by -2 to every roll, affecting ability tests and potential harm, and preventing the “might” focus from being added to the threat points. The trap automatically resets after it is triggered. The effect lasts for 2 rounds. 

Illusory Treasure Hoard

**Type:** Magical

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d8 (Illusion)

**Effect:** Illusion and Enfeeblement

**Defenses:** Fortitude → Willpower + Resistance saving throw

**Area:** Room or chamber

**Description:** This trap lures adventurers with the promise of a magnificent treasure hoard. Upon entering the room, they are greeted with an illusionary display of opulent riches. However, the illusion is only the beginning. The trap triggers an enchantment that affects those within the area. The illusory treasures fade away, and the characters find their physical strength draining away due to the enchantment’s enfeebling effect. The trap can be defended against by making a Willpower → Resistance saving throw. If failed, the characters will suffer the curse of enfeeblement, weakening their Feats of Strength and combat abilities. The trap automatically resets after being triggered.

Microburst (Arcane Ward) 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d10 

**Effect:** 2d10 threat points 

**Defenses:** Fortitude (saving throw) then Fortitude DP 

**Area:** One creature. 

**Description:** This permanent arcane ward can be placed on almost anything: a book, a door, a chest, a robe, a wand, etc. Anyone other than the caster who touches the item is engulfed in a powerful sudden reversal of gravity and then slammed back to the ground by another reversal of gravity. The top of the shaft is filled with spikes (for the 2d6 threat points). The trap is constant. 

Nightmares 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect/Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d8 

**Effect:** Inflicts 6+d6 (7–12) threat points per round for d4 rounds, followed by a stun for d6 rounds. 

**Saving Throws:** Cognitive (Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy) 

**Area:** A forest glade, a room, or an entire (haunted) manor. 

**Description:** The Nightmares trap assaults creatures attempting to rest in its area with terrifying dreams, draining their mental and physical resilience. The trap's effect lasts for d4 rounds, during which the target must make Cognitive Saving Throws using their Competence combined with Expertise in Wizardry or Theurgy to resist the mental manipulation. Failure to resist results in accumulating threat points and subsequent incapacitation. The default saving throw against this mental affliction is the target's Fortitude versus Willpower, with the GM having the discretion to modify this based on the trap's specific effects.

Poison Needle Trap 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect/Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d10 

**Effect:** Administers a potent poison, inflicting 1d8 points of loss to passive defense per hour. 

**Defenses:** _Valorous Save_: Uses a Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance or Vitality save to endure the poison's effects. _Armor_: Protective gauntlets offer an additional defense, potentially preventing the needle from piercing the skin. 

**Area:** Affects one creature. 

**Description:** Concealed within a lock, this trap houses a poisoned needle that pricks the finger of anyone attempting to pick the lock without adequate hand protection. The insidious toxin weakens the victim gradually, sapping their strength hour by hour until it is neutralized or results in death. To resist the full effects of the poison, a character must rely on their physical resilience, using a Valorous Save. Wearing sturdy gauntlets offers a physical barrier against the needle's puncture. The duration of the poison's effects is determined by its concoction and can vary, leaving the discretion to the Game Master to adjust the trap's lethality. Once triggered, the trap is designed for single use only.

Poisonous Gas Cloud 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 to 2d10 / 2d4 to 2d8 

**Effect:** Poison; either 2d6 to 2d12 threat points, once, or 1d8 to 2d6 Fortitude loss per hour

**Defenses:** Active DP, exceeding threat points reduce Fortitude DP

**Area:** 5-foot diameter cloud 

**Description:** This trap can be placed virtually anywhere: the mouth of a statue, the keyhole on a treasure chest or a door, etc., or it could just be an alchemical effort gone wrong. When triggered, a small glass container breaks, and the gas escapes. The potency of the gas is variable, and it can have a one-time effect on any who contacted it or linger until neutralized. The trap does not reset. 

Rat Box 

**Type:** Magical Trap

**Detect/Disarm:** Detect with a 2d6 roll, disarm with a 2d4 roll. Dispel Magic may also neutralize the trap.

**Effect:** Upon activation, the Rat Box imposes a +1 Battle Phase penalty on initiative for the next action of all characters within a 5-foot radius. Additionally, these affected characters sustain 1d4 Threat Points of damage.

**Defenses:** A Cognitive + Expertise (Wizardry or Theurgy) save may lessen or negate the initiative penalty. Active Defense Points can mitigate the damage.

**Area:** 5-foot radius around the box.

**Description:** The Rat Box is a small container thrumming with arcane energy. When touched, it unleashes a swarm of aggressive, illusory rats. This spectral onslaught is a multifaceted threat, aimed at disorienting and harming those who fall victim to its deceptive nature. 

The Reverse Pit 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d12 

**Effect:** 18+d6 (19–24) threat points, + 2d6 threat points 

**Defenses:** Fortitude → Willpower → Resistance 

**Area:** One creature 

**Description:** An overhead shaft of 20 feet in height is masked by an illusionary 10-foot square section of the ceiling. The unfortunate character is propelled upward via a whirlwind, lifted rapidly into the air, and then dashed to the ground when stepping under the shaft. 

Screaming Crystal 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 1d4 / 3d12 

**Effect:** Increasing threat points + status effect (see below)

**Defenses:** Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience saving throw. 

**Area:** 5-foot radius 

**Description:** Any creature moving within 5 feet of this shiny glowing crystal shard will evoke supernatural screams from the souls trapped within. Every round, the basic effect gets more serious, inflicting increasing damage; any creature whose Willpower is brought to zero, suffers distraction in round 1, stunning in round 2, and incapacitation in round 3 [round one 2d6 + distract, round two 3d6 + stun; round three 18+d6 (19–24) + incapacitate]. The trap resets once every living thing within the area of effect is unconscious. 

Slanting Corridor 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d6 

**Effect:** 2d8 to 2d12 threat points, possibly + 2d8 threat points* 

**Defenses:** Active DP 

**Area:** Special 

**Description:** A corridor of varying lengths leads to an ornate metal door. The door is quite large and looks very secure. When enough weight is gathered in front of the door (generally three persons), a section of the corridor suddenly slants downward, dumping all into a shallow pit slightly larger than the door. The door, which is merely a large metal weight, falls in on top of them. 

* If his Active DP reaches zero, a character is trapped beneath the metal weight and may suffer further damage. The trap does not reset. 

Spear Trap 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 1d8 / 1d8 

**Effect:** 2d10 threat points 

**Defenses:** Active DP 

**Area:** 10-foot radius 

**Description:** Activating this trap fires a spear that can pierce an 1d4 number of enemies in a straight line when activated; the initial target chosen at random from those in its path. When the spear hits a wall or reaches its maximum range of 200 feet, it retracts. 

Spiked Pit Trap 

**Type:** Mechanical. This trap is a mechanically engineered hazard designed to catch the unwary.

**Detect / Disarm:** Detection and disarmament of the Spiked Pit Trap require rolls of 2d4 and 2d12, respectively.

**Effect:** The trap inflicts 2d10 threat points due to the fall, and an additional 2d6 threat points from the spikes at the bottom of the pit.

**Defenses:** Characters can use their Active Defense Points and Armor to mitigate some of the damage from this trap.

**Area:** The trap covers a 10-foot square area and is triggered when more than 150 pounds of weight is placed upon it.

**Description:** The Spiked Pit Trap consists of a 10-foot by 10-foot floor section rigged to collapse under sufficient weight, dropping anything on it into a 20-foot deep pit lined with cruelly rusted spikes. The fall causes harm, and the rusty spikes beckon below. Characters can avoid the fall, and thus the spikes, by successfully using their Active Defense Points. Escaping the pit requires a Fortitude > Strength roll of moderate difficulty (2d4). Once triggered, this trap cannot be reset.

Spin Trap 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d6 / 2d6 

**Effect:** Turns creatures around 

**Defenses:** The advantage “Sense of Direction” 

**Area:** Usually 5 to 10-foot square to trigger, but as large as desired 

**Description:** Stepping into this area triggers a magic field that affects every sentient creature standing within 10 feet of the area or another affected creature, like a chain reaction. All creatures are immediately faced in the opposite direction. This creates no sensation other than confusion, but it can be problematic if the Spin Trap takes effect in darkness or a hall of mirrors. The advantage of a “sense of direction” thwarts the trap outright for those possessing it. 

Tainted Trove 

**Type:** Magical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d8 (Illusion) 

**Effect:** Poison 2d10 threat points per hour until neutralized, ending one day after contact 

**Defenses:** Armor, Shield, Active DP 

**Area:** One or more creatures 

**Description:** A vast and fantastic treasure trove is discovered containing all manner of valuables as devised by the GM. This is an intricate illusion layered on top of base metal coins, rocks, junk weapons, etc. Everything has been treated with a slow-acting but very potent contact poison, activated by body heat, that will eat away at Fortitude, likely resulting in death. Unused poison dissipates with the illusion a few minutes after contact, and the trap does not reset. 

Tripwire 

**Type:** Mechanical 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d4 to 2d8 / 2d4 to 2d8 

**Effect:** 2d4 to 2d10 threat points 

**Defenses:** Active DP 

**Area:** One creature 

**Description:** A very thin, camouflaged, or hidden tripwire springs the trap when broken. The exact nature of the trap is variable and left to the discretion of the GM. It could be darts, or a pendulum blade, or a falling block, etc. The trap does not reset. 

Wards, Sigils and Rune Traps

Symbol traps are a unique and potent category of magical traps, meticulously crafted through rare and often dangerous rituals. While some symbol 'traps' may echo existing magic effects like Activate or Afflict, following standard spell potency rules and functioning as magical items, others mirror the terrible power outlined in the Trap Level Table. These potent traps, woven by the most skilled and ruthless of magic-wielders, require an Adept matching the trap's level and an expenditure of Spirit Points proportional to the trap's power (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 at creation), without the need for further maintenance.

Unlike simple wards, symbol traps manifest as glyphs, runes, or sigils, their effects extending far beyond mere warnings. They inflict enhanced harm, mirroring the Trap Table for their potential damage, and the ritual to bind them is correspondingly complex and demanding. Once complete, the trap lies in wait, triggered by the simple act of a footstep or the whisper of a forgotten passphrase. While most require rejuvenation over time as their energies fade (especially those with long-term impacts), some legendary traps may bear the mark of a permanency spell.

All symbol traps are the product of ritual magic. Adepts, with the aid of their Magic Rituals feat, gather mundane and esoteric components, painstakingly inscribing the chosen symbol onto a surface or item. Only then does the work of weaving raw magical energies into the symbol's form begin, a process filled with incantations and careful manipulation. 

Magical Symbol Trap 

**Detect / Disarm:** 2d8 / 2d10 

**Effect:** Inflicts entropic damage, depleting Active DP and bypassing armor. Deals a total of 2d6 Threat Points, with half the damage first targeting Active DP. Targets must also attempt a Valorous Save (Fortitude + Strength) to resist being restrained and suffering a -2 penalty to all physical ability tests. 

**Defenses:** Valorous Save (Fortitude + Strength) prevents restraint and penalties. Active DP mitigates some damage if not fully depleted by the entropic effect. 

**Area:** 10-foot radius 

**Description:** This subtle ward is inscribed on a surface or object. When triggered, it summons spectral chains that bind all within its radius, hindering their movement and reducing their physical prowess. The ward remains active until dispelled or its duration ends.

Sigil of Searing Light

**Type:** Magical Symbol Trap Detect / Disarm: 1d8 / 2d8 

**Effect:** Emits a burst of blinding light, causing 3d8 Threat Points and escalating disorientation. Targets must make a Skillful Saving Throw (Reflexes + Agility). On a failed save, they take an additional 1d6 Threat Points per round that they remain within the area, and suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to Skillful saves for each round exposed. 

**Defenses:** Successful Skillful Save (Reflexes + Agility) negates disorientation penalties and reduces damage taken by half. 

**Area:** 15-foot radius 

**Description:** This sigil, often etched upon doorways or treasure chests, unleashes a cone of intense light when activated. Those caught unaware suffer burning pain and escalating disorientation, hindering their ability to react.

Chapter 8: Encounters

Role-playing games are not exciting without conflict. After all, these games are about adventure, allowing us to step out of our mundane existence, vicariously clobbering wickedness in the fantasy, modern, or science fiction realms.

Eldritch makes it easy to create opponents in the game. GMs do not have to spend hours creating statistics for them but can focus on speedy action and excitement during play.

Social Encounters

Eldritch, like most RPGs, encourages those Game Masters weaving stories in collaboration with their players to consider more than just combat. It is up to the Game Master to queue up plenty of opportunities for players to engage in social interaction while achieving fame, exploring mythical lands, and defeating their foes. 

Most contests between a player character and a non-player character are opposed, the total of a difficulty check using Competence → Adroitness → Cleverness, or Skulduggery or Perception → Perspicacity compared to an opposed roll by the opponent, which could be Fortitude → Willpower → Courage (to avoid intimation), Competence → Perception → Perspicacity (to detect deception), or other combinations depending on circumstance and GM fiat in collaboration with player ingenuity. 

As with all contests between two living subjects in the game, the higher result wins, with the defender winning a tie.

It’s recommended that Game Masters roll the opposing dice of the NPC’s opposing traits/skills in secret, at least during key scenes of high stakes, so that no player can automatically know whether one attempt at persuasion, intimation or other types of influence was successful beyond a doubt. This can enhance tension. Likewise, the Game Masters may secretly roll a difficulty check using one of the character’s traits or skills, testing the character’s passive insight or perceptual skills. 

The GM may use either an NPC’s opposing ability branch (simple contest) or a challenge die determined by the relative difficulty as decided. Some examples: 

Is the NPC lying? Is the Guild Master of Thieves NPC lying about where the treasure is? The GM asks the players to each roll their Competence → Perception → Perspicacity, but in this case, applied to notice the nuances of body language or facial expressions. 

Will the NPC trust us? The party meets a guard at the gate, one who by rumor despises his corrupt captain. The player characters try to persuade this guard to pass to infiltrate the quarters and subdue his captain. Competence → Perception → Perspicacity.

Can the NPC be persuaded? Advantages like empathy may aid a character in persuading, influencing one with guile, kindness, compassion, or unnerving insight. Use Competence → Adroitness→ Cleverness or Skulduggery vs Competence → Perception → Perspicacity. 

Or perhaps one would employ the advantage of intimation or brutishness, the GM calling for a contest of Fortitude → Strength with Ferocity or Might if possessed versus the target’s Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience.

Is the NPC subdued or acquiescent? One who is commanding may take charge and affect the morale of those in their charge or cause fear in the ranks of their enemies. An NPC losing a contest using Fortitude → Willpower may be cowed, acquiescent to any demand, or retreat altogether. 

NPC Reactions 

Some NPCs are weak-willed in concept or unimportant in the grand scheme of the story. These individuals are particularly subject to player character persuasion, diplomacy, or intimation. For minor NPCs, encounters need not be overly defined.

The GM may decide that any cowardly or too changeable personality trait is the antithesis of any particular NPC of importance.

Or, if more lenient, the game master may consider any favorable reaction for a sharply defined NPC concept as unlikely, even while allowing the dice to have some influence over outcomes. 

Social Saving Throws

Most creatures use their Saving Throw dice as as the default opposing dice in social contests using either traits or skills. 

For important NPCs, the game master may assign different Saving Throw dice for social aspects or add more traits during the session prep (or on the fly) to further modify the opposed rolls.

The game master has the ability to modify an NPC's roles based on an impassioned speech or a social mistake. Similarly, the GM can choose to modify a creature's social capabilities if they are using a power of magic, but this decision ultimately depends on the specific NPC or monster in question.

For more information on NPCs and other encounter types, please refer to the Game Mastering and Opponents section of the book. Some traits that may modify contest of skill or saving throws are listed below. 

**Courageous:** The NPC/Creature adds a bonus of +1 to +4 to contests of ability that are meant to intimidate or coerce the subject through fear or imposing physical presence.

The Eldritch role-playing game is about the story, and the rules are only brought up when needed or fit with how the story is going. Few things kill the fun at the table faster than a fight that turns into a discussion of the rules or the rolling of dice that stops the action from happening.

This section of the rules gives you all the information you need to understand and create creatures and NPCs in the game. 

Quick Combat Encounters

Eldritch has five creature categories (described in full below), but most random combat encounters can be dealt with simply using three of them. 

Decide if the opponents are minor (weak), standard (average), or exceptional (tough). They use one, two, or three dice respectively for both hit points (using MV) and potential harm. 

Assign a die type for rank and file (d4 or d6), and higher ones for stronger individuals or henchmen (d6 or d8), and leader types (d8, d10, or d12) if present. 

Determine the numbers appearing and circumstances of the encounter to suit the campaign. For example, do you want to ambush the adventurers with a dozen scrawny bandits? As minor foes they have a single die. Most are d4 bandits with 4 hit points doing d4 points of potential harm in attacks. 

A d6 mage with them has 6 hit points and can inflict d6 potential harm with her spells, their d8 leader has 8 hit points and does d8 points of potential harm. 

Standard foes (such as healthy bandits) would use two dice for hit points and potential harm (2d4 etc.), and so on. It’s that simple.

Creature Categories 

There are five creature categories in Eldritch: minor, standard, exceptional, and legendary. Minor, standard, and exceptional creatures are usually straightforward to handle in combat, utilizing Quick Stat Blocks for simplicity, but legendary creatures are a different matter. While they do not use a full-fledged character sheet like PCs, they often possess superior abilities, a wider breadth of knowledge, or unusual powers that make them stand out from other opponents. 

However, this doesn't preclude other types of creatures or characters, whether NPC or beast or monster, from having intelligence, personality, skills, or other abilities. Of course, there is no bar to creating interesting personalities, quirks, and strategies for lesser foes. The section on Monstrous Tropes is at the end of this chapter and describes how to create a range of impromptu monsters that can help guide you in inventing new ones. 

Minor Opponents 

Minor opponents are the most common type and the easiest to defeat in combat. This bottom end category consists of abundant and inferior monsters, usually encountered in numbers, but whose individual inefficiency makes large-scale battles against them swift. 

Examples include rapacious hordes of goblins or kobolds, ordinary rabble, inexperienced town militias, and weaker undead minions like skeletons and zombies. 

Minor opponents uncommonly have more than one attack type above d4 (see Threat Dice below) and are usually medium-sized or smaller. 

At the GM’s discretion, strong minor creatures (e.g. goblin leaders) may have more than one single die attack higher than d4, but no more than d12. They rarely have much treasure.

Standard Opponents 

Standard opponents are more of a threat but usually no match for a single PC. 

Typical standard creatures include town guards, ordinary soldiers, common criminals, experienced hirelings, and animals and monsters of all sorts. 

These foes use up to two dice to attack (2d6 etc.) and can inflict significant damage to a hero when attacking in force, especially if they number eight or more.

Exceptional Opponents

Exceptional creatures pose a serious threat, use up to three dice to attack (3d8 etc.), have more hit points, and are tougher to defeat. 

Experienced warriors, assassins, dangerous animals like bears or wolves, or any other major opponent can be an exceptional foe. 

Legendary Opponents

Legendary opponents in the game can be either NPCs or creatures that are nearly as fully developed or at least as relevant to the narrative as the player characters (PCs). They are typically exceptional in overall ability, and include monsters like gorgons, chimeras, lesser dragons, golems, and werewolves, which pose a great threat.

What sets legendary opponents apart from other categories of opponents is that the title of "legendary" can be associated with any creature, from minor to legendary in terms of combat strength. 

Legendary opponents may have exceptional-level Threat Dice and abilities, and their die ranks can exceed d12 or 3d12, unlike any other category of opponent. Legendary monsters and iconic NPCs are the only opponents in the game that can possess ranks of d14, d16, d18, and d20, up to 3d20. 

Some monsters can also attack with innate arcane aptitudes, such as the fiery breath of a dragon or the supernatural, paralyzing scream of a banshee. In some cases, spells and powers, such as mind control or stunning effects, use Opposed Rolls rather than straight damage.

Uncommon die ranks 

Player adventurers typically use standard dice (d4 to d12). Powerful NPCs and monsters may use unusual dice (d3, d5, d7, d16, d24), available as “Zocchi dice” online. Standard dice can simulate these: d3 (d6 ÷ 2), d5 (d10 ÷ 2), d7 (d8, re-roll 8), or d16 (d20, ignore 17+).Creating Creature Stats

Regardless of whether they are friend or foe, all creatures and NPCs in the game adhere to the following statistical template.

**Type (TY):** minor (weak), average (typical), or exceptional (difficult).

**Threat Dice (TD):** Assign one, two, or three dice, respectively, for potential harm in each category of Melee (weapons), Natural (unarmed attacks or claws and teeth), Ranged (missile weapons or natural ranged attacks), and Arcane (innate magic or prepared spells that harm) potential harm. 

**Extra Attacks (EA):**list any extra attacks within the round, representing most anything; breath weapons, extra limbs, mind powers, or incredible speed.

**Hit Points (HP):** Hit points for creatures are calculated based on their threat level and attack forms. All creatures, including minor, standard, exceptional, and legendary creatures, have hit points equal to the maximum value of their highest threat category. The final hit points score is further modified by the creature’s size and nature. The size of a creature can range from minuscule to gargantuan, with each size category having a corresponding modifier. The nature of a creature can be mundane, magical, preternatural, or supernatural, with each nature category also having a corresponding modifier.

**Damage Reduction (PR):** This score adds bonus hit points to the creature’s overall HP score if less than Legendary in status. The bonus represents armor and shielding (see Creature Armor and Shields Bonus HP in this chapter). If Legendary, then damage reduction is normally listed as a damage reduction die rank. 

**Saving Throw (ST):** All creatures have a saving throw that allows them to resist physical or mental afflictions, whether spells, hazards, or other misfortunes, including sometimes social or mental contests.  

**Battle Phase (BP):** Represents the creature’s basic prowess, determining its initiative phase within a battle round before modifiers. 

**Notes:** All special notes concerning this creature, including specific weapons, armor, and treasure (sometimes abbreviated WAT), are listed here. 

Attack Forms 

As described above, most creatures do not have detailed ability branches, and their attack forms are simply grouped under Melee, Natural, Ranged, and Arcane. 

If there is a need to specify potential harm further, for instance if a player character has magic armor with a bonus against cutting attacks, this is easy to decide on the spot. A giant uses a club to pulverize, but wyvern claws slash or pierce, so the armor’s bonus only applies to the latter.

Threat Dice 

Threat Dice describe all attack forms available to a creature. Such attacks are abstract, with weapon modifiers used only where circumstances warrant, and ability trees only considered for unusual or Legendary opponents.

Creature attacks are classified as **Melee**, **Natural**, **Ranged**, and **Arcane**. 

These cover all attacks with hand weapons, natural weapons (claws, teeth, hooves), missile weapons, and magic respectively. 

All humanoids possess a minimum of d4 in Melee, Natural, and Ranged. 

This would allow them to use close attacks with melee weapons or ranged attacks with missile weapons if they were available. 

The GM should use common sense to decide whether other creatures can use melee or ranged attacks based on biology. 

For instance, apes might easily use branches as clubs and possibly use rocks as missiles, but normal bears cannot throw stones. 

A creature’s main attack is whichever attack form has the highest potential harm (the threat dice with the highest MV).

The maximum threat rank for a **Minor** creature is 1d12, for a **Standard** creature is 2d12, and for an **Exceptional** or **Legendary** creature it is 3d12. 

The creature's main attack must be the highest threat rank among the categories and the other categories must not equal or exceed the main attack category. 

For example, a minor creature with a d12 main attack in melee can have a maximum of d10 in any other category. A creature of standard type with 2d12 in the arcane attack category may have up to 2d10 in any other attack category or other combinations, such as d4 + d4 + d4.

An Exceptional creature can have up to 3d12 in any category or combination of categories.

Generally, attacks by ferocious animals are Natural (but may be as potent as weapons).

Some uncommon attacks are ranged, such as the projectile quills of a manticore, the acidic spit of a giant frog, or a behemoth that rips trees from the ground to throw at human pests.

Arcane Attacks

Some monsters have the ability to attack using arcane means, such as a dragon's fiery breath or an energy bolt from a unicorn's horn. These types of attacks are considered magical and use the Harm effect by default. Arcane attacks do not require a challenge die as an ability test, but some special attacks that can add bonuses to damage or bypass shields or armor require a test in the form of a saving throw. 

The default range of an arcane attack form is 10 Arcane MV in feet, with a radius or other dimension of up to 2 × the MV of the threat level. Otherwise, the range of spell-like attacks is determined by the nature of the attack or by the range listed for an equivalent spell. It will be noted if a creature is capable of other magical effects or possesses innate magical abilities resembling spells.

Threat Bonus or Extra Attacks

Some of the most powerful creatures have abilities that allow them to inflict additional damage as a result of their exceptional natural abilities, size, or nature. This bonus, called the threat bonus, ranges from +1 to +5 and is added to the category of threat dice (Melee, Natural, Ranged, or Arcane) on each strike. 

Additionally, some monsters have special attacks in addition to their normal ones. These special attacks can be of any type (physical, mental, or magical) and take any form (claws, bite, fire breath, psychic lash), but they must fit within the creature's concept. If the creature can perform multiple attacks, the threat bonus applies to each roll. However, the bonus does not apply to any additional attacks unless otherwise specified.

**The extra attacks are always occur one battle phase after the creature’s regular attacks in the round**. This rule is designed to better simulate special creatures with unusual attack combinations such as hellhounds, multi-limbed demons or golems, giant squid, giant snakes, dragons, two-headed giants with mystic aptitudes, hydras, and so on.

Note that extra attacks (and modifiers to hit points) based on size or supernatural properties can change a creature's category. 

For example, an otherwise minor monster with great celerity that has three extra attacks a round, even if none are above a single die, it is no longer a minor creature because its maximum potential harm per round has increased.

Creature Hit Points 

Base creature hit points are calculated based on the maximum value of their highest threat category. This counts threat dice only, without extra attacks or extra damage due to special effects or bonuses. 

Hit points can be modified depending on the creature’s size and nature, and the resultant HP score is split as described below.

HP Modifiers

Size

Size is minuscule, tiny, small, medium, large, huge, or gargantuan, as per the table.

_Creature Size Modifier_

• Minuscule or tiny modifier (mouse to cat): +0

• Small or medium modifier (goblin to human): +1

• Large modifier (horse, bear, tiger): +2

• Huge modifier (elephant, giant squid, wyvern): +3

• Gargantuan modifier (dragon, dinosaur, whale): +4 

Nature 

Nature is mundane, magical, preternatural, or supernatural. Mundane creatures are normal and not innately magical (although they may possess magic abilities). Magical creatures such as unicorns are innately magical, but not otherworldly. Preternatural creatures include most magical monsters, generally anything corporeal but weird. Supernatural creatures are other- worldly and include incorporeal undead such as ghosts, as well as angels and elementals. 

_Creature Nature Modifier_

• Mundane (human, dwarf, wolf): +1

• Magical (fay, shee, werewolf): +2

• Preternatural (golem, hag, plant monster): +3

• Supernatural (demon, elemental, ghost): +4 

Add the two modifiers together, halve that sum (do not round), then multiply base hit points by the result (round up). 

The resultant single, abstract hit points score combines Active (Prowess-based) and Passive (Fortitude-based) defenses, making it very open to GM narrative interpretation during battles.

Splitting HP —Active / Passive 

Every creature’s hit points are split 50/50 to simulate active/passive defenses. Creature hit points in the are listed in the format: 

**HP**: total (active/ passive defense) [constitution, size, nature; HP multiplier].

Creatures in the game have hit points that are divided into active and passive categories based on their description, which can fall into the categories of regular, tough, or fast. Regular split is 50/50%, tough is 25/75%, and fast is 75/25%. 

For example, a minor but large, fast-moving serpent with a vicious bite might be a fast d12 creature, with 9 active and 3 passive hit points. This split becomes important when certain feats or spells bypass a creature's active defense points or determine whether poison or other contact effects are activated when penetrating active defense.

These rules are guidelines, and GMs may alter hit point scores to suit the circumstances and their conception of creatures. What seems right for a monster is more important than the mechanical application of modifiers. A large but unrobust creature (such as a giraffe) or a not particularly magical monster might get no modifier. 

However, fragile creatures with strong attacks can have their hit points reduced, while some creatures can be made very hard to harm, although total modifiers should not exceed +5. As noted under Extra Attacks, modifiers to hit points based on size or properties can change a creature's category. GMs can also give monsters different HP splits, such as 20/80 or 66/34 if that fits the concept better.

Understanding Creature Defense

Active defense is a measure of a creature's ability to actively resist or deflect attacks. Once this defense is fully depleted, the creature becomes vulnerable to specific effects that require breaking through its active defense. Nevertheless, the actual impact and consequences of an attack are determined by the Game Master's narrative interpretation.

For example, if a creature with hit points of (33/101) loses its initial 33 points of active defense, the GM isn't necessarily compelled to portray the creature as passively taking damage. It might still dodge or relocate to elude the attack, but now it's susceptible to effects that demand breaching active defense points, like touch-based poisons or other afflictions. 

Essentially, Active Defense engenders an 'effective' shield - it blocks the activation of penetrating factors like toxicity or other risky effects if the Active Defense remains operative (i.e., maintains a score above zero).

Damage Reduction

The rules for armor and shields in regard most opponents are crafted for flexibility This framework applies to all GM-controlled creatures, from the ordinary to the extraordinary. The GM has the liberty to apply the conventional method, using an armor die to decide damage reduction, or a simplified approach, assigning a consistent hit point bonus that corresponds to the armor's quality and strength. This decision is important for creatures of remarkable or legendary stature. The GM may implement the actual roll of an armor die for tougher opponents, usually those of exceptional or legendary status, though it can lengthen the duration of combat. 

**Simplified armor:** GMs can enhance creature durability by assigning "hit point" bonuses based on armor protection die rank, ranging from zero for lightly or unarmored creatures to +6 for those in high-quality armor, like mithral or adamantine (d12 armor die). These points are added to passive hit points. Shields, in contrast, directly reduce Potential Harm:small shields by 1 point, medium by 2, and large by 3. These "hit point" bonuses from normal armor are not pre-included in the bestiary's base stats, giving GMs flexibility to adjust challenge levels in encounters. See also Special Opponent Defenses, page 222.

Magic and Protection 

Regarding spells influencing armor, the Protect effect can either adhere to the conventional armor rules, involving damage reduction dice, or they can adjust a creature's hit points directly, in line with the Armor Bonus HP chart. For instance, a spell replicating the impact of a d10 armor might increase or decrease a creature’s hit points by 5, influenced by the spell's nature and its role in the game. 

_Natural Armor_

Most normal creatures have damage reduction for neither shields nor armor. Their HP score takes normal skin, hide, or fur into account.

Legendary Damage Reduction

Legendary humanoid types and other creatures wearing armor (such as horse barding), use armor and shields in the same way as player characters by default. 

In Legendary creatures, armor reduces threat points that surpass their active defense points based on armor type and a die roll. Shields, however, operate distinctly, offering fixed damage reduction values: small shields reduce 1 point, medium shields reduce 2 points, and large shields reduce 3 points. These shields range from compact forearm guards to substantial elemental barriers. Some creatures may have natural or magical defenses akin to armor or shields.

Natural Armor Equivalents

_Armor Types_

**None** 

• Bonus: +0 HP

• Description: No armor.

**Hide (Tough Pelt)** 

• Bonus: d4 or +2 HP

• Description: Basic protection, like a tough skin.

**Leather (Scales or Pangolin Plates)** 

• Bonus: d6 or +3 HP

• Description: Strong protection, resembling a bony outer layer.

**Plate (Heavy Exoskeleton)** 

• Bonus: d10 or +5 HP

• Description: Highlevel protection, similar to a heavy outer shell.

**Mithral (Adamantine Shell)** 

• Bonus: d12 or +6 HP

• Description: Compact defense; e.g., a hardened forearm guard or small magical force field.

**Medium Shield** 

• Damage Reduction: 2

• Description: Standard protection; e.g., a sturdy bone or wood piece, or a magical aura.

**Large Shield** 

• Damage Reduction: 3

• Description: Substantial defense; e.g., a large carapace section or an elemental barrier.

Creature Saving Throws 

Monster and NPC saving throws come into play when a magic effect, special power, or deadly trap triggers a status effect (see Afflictions, page 245). 

Every creature is assigned a Saving Throw rank, usually from d4 up through d12, although, for legendary creatures it can be up to d20+, which applies to every situation requiring an opposed roll. This usually represents Fortitude but can cover more, either as noted on the creature description or assigned by GM fiat. Some creatures have different saving throws against different attack types, listed after the basic one, e.g., ST d4; d10 versus Magic; 2d8 versus Melee feats. 

Threat ranks may sometimes stand in as saving throws (if indicated). For GMs making up opponents on the fly, this table can serve as a rough guideline.

**_Creature Saving Throws_**

• **Minor** d4

• **Standard** d6

• **Exceptional** d8 to d12

• **Legendary** d14, d16, d18, d20, d24, d30

Battle Phase (Initiative) 

During a round each creature acts in a particular Battle Phase. There is no formula for this. It varies for each monster and animal, so a small cat will act before a large sloth. 

It is loosely based on average or assumed agility or prowess for the creature. The Battle Phase die can stand in for agility or prowess as needed. Particular opponents may have initiative modified by weapon bonuses or other class-based or magical factors.

Creature Movement Rate

Movement in Eldritch is usually abstract, with the GM tracking everything. If it is important, maximum movement can be determined by the MV of the Battle Phase die (standing in for prowess) for all creatures. 

As a guideline, most humanoids and similar bipeds can walk at 4 miles per hour (20 yards per 10-second round). Most four-legged medium or large animals have a base movement rate in mph corresponding to their BP die MV (d4 = 4 mph up to d12 = 12 mph). 

Smaller and larger creatures (minuscule, tiny, huge, gargantuan) move at half the rate. 

Running or charging is at twice normal rate, and sprinting thrice. Especially speedy creatures (antelope, cheetahs, horses without riders) can also run and sprint more quickly: movement ×3 and ×5, respectively. 

Creature Example 

We have a scenario in mind: “A Bad Bear Day.” Wishing for there to be bears in our bestiary, we create the statistics. Bears are tough, grouchy, dangerous animals, thick-furred, not that fast, and strong enough to crush foes in a brutal hug. Working through the encounter details above, we decide they pose a significant threat, and have natural armor and an extra attack. Liking honey and hibernating in winter have no bearing on game stats. We quickly put together the statistics below – more than a bare outline, but hardly an unbearable burden.**Bear**

**Type (TY):** Exceptional 

**Threat Dice (TD):** Melee zero ~ Natural 3d4, 3d6, or 3d8 ~ Ranged zero ~ Arcane zero 

**Extra Attacks (EA):** 2d4, 2d6, or 2d8 

**Hit Points (HP):** 18 (5/13), 27 (7/20), or 36 (9/27) [tough, large, mundane; ×1.5]. 

**Damage Reduction (DR):** Shield 0, armor +3 to HP. (thick fur). 

**Saving Throw (ST):** d8 

**Battle Phase (BP):** 4 (d6) 

**Notes:** Bears are lumbering but dangerous if provoked or in a bad mood. The three listings are for types of bear: black, brown/grizzly, and kodiak or polar in that order. The main attack is clawing. The extra attack is a bear hug, which only occurs if armor is penetrated in the main attack.

Unusual Monster and NPC Ability

Some legendary opponents are listed with several dice for the basic ability even before considering specialties. 

In such a case, a specialty would add another die or dice when using that ability branch, e.g., 2d6 (basic Competence) + d8 (Perception specialty). Threat Dice for some unusual monsters are listed in exactly this manner. Some powerful magic items and spells can also have similar effects.

Treasure

The GM determines regular equipment and treasure depending on the type of creature and encounter circumstances. Opponents can carry whatever weapons and armor suit their roles. 

Adventurers like fortune hunters, explorers, buccaneers, and swashbucklers typically carry equipment appropriate to their experience and power. 

Specialized NPCs like infamous mages, reclusive druids, and prominent theurgists often have magic items. Commoners — serfs, menial servants, ordinary soldiers, peasants, tavern keepers, hedge magicians, and so on — carry whatever their station entails. 

Nobles often possess the highest quality clothes, armor, and weapons, and typically wear fine jewelry. Rogues and assassins carry thieves' tools, often poison vials, and occasionally magic items designed for deception. 

Monsters from minor to legendary may possess treasure depending on their ecology and culture. Ancient hoards of hidden treasure can contain whatever the GM wants, including powerful guardians and deadly traps. The following table serves as a quick guideline to treasure sizes.

**_Treasure Type—Value—Chance of Magic_**

• Trinkets: $1–5 —01%— 1 item

• Small cache: $2–20 —05% / 1 item

• Cache: $20–200— 10% / 1 item

• Small trove: $100–500— 20% d2 items

• Trove: $200–2000— 30% / d3 items

• Hoard: $1000–10,000— 40% / d4 items

• Dragon’s hoard: $10,000–50,000+ 50% d8 items

To determine equipment and treasure for encounters, Game Masters can use the table provided as a quick guide to inspire what loot and treasures might be discovered during exploration or after defeating foes (See magic items listings, page 181).

As described under equipment rules, dollar amounts can be assigned to items in the game world, making them comparable to things in our own world (e.g. bread and ale for food, horse and cart or chariot for transportation, etc.).

Suggested precious metal values are gold $500 per coin, silver $10 per coin, and copper $1 per ten coins. Coin weight is taken as an ounce each (but can be anything you want from that to 100 per pound, as for some ancient coinage). A little reading on ancient and medieval history ought to give the GM sufficient imagery for the rest.

NPCs

The rules for NPCs and monsters in the game aim to streamline the GM's job and facilitate quick play. While creating a “full-fledged” NPC is a legitimate option, it is not mandatory. In cases where GMs prefer to do so, these rules can help simplify the process.

Most NPCs are categorized into four varieties: minor, standard, exceptional, and legendary. They use the normal monster statistical template rather than a full character sheet. Nonetheless, GMs have several options for creating NPCs. They can use the conventional character creation procedures to make a complete NPC and develop it to the desired level, use one of the provided templates and modify it to fit the NPC, or assign the appropriate values directly. 

It's worth noting that character experience is measured in level ranges, and the game doesn't necessarily equate fighting power with importance. A full-fledged character can serve various roles and may be weaker than a standard adventurer. 

NPC Level & CP Range Template 

Level 1: 30 to 100 CPs, AAB 

Level 2: 101 to 199 CPs, ABC 

Level 3: 200 to 299 CPs, BCD 

Level 4: 300 to 399 CPs, CDD 

Level 5: 400 to 500+ CPs, CDE

Quick NPCs

Start with an Eldritch Character Sheet. Based on character class or concept, decide on NPC level, and his or her first, second, and third most important abilities. Using the key below, allocate die ranks and focus areas by the template letters above for NPC level, left to right from least to most important.

A = Ability d4, 3 × Specialty d4.

B = Ability d6, 3 × Specialty d6, 1 × Focus +1.

C = Ability d8, 3 × Specialty d8, 3 × Focus +1.

D = Ability d10, 3 × Specialty d10, 2 × Focus +2, 4 × Focus +1.

E = Ability d12, 3 × Specialty d12, 3 × Focus +3, 3 × Focus +2.

Modify race and class specifics, adjusting specialties and focuses to reflect unique traits. Calculate defense scores, add class-appropriate advantages, feats, and magic spells. Determine equipment and treasure. Conclude with a concise personality sketch and relevant campaign notes.

Complete NPC Example

To create Beraz, a level 3 dwarf warrior, we use the level 3 template B Ability die, assigning B to Competence, C to Fortitude and D to Prowess. 

After assigning the die ranks, we adjust Fortitude to dwarven minimum and decide Beraz would concentrate on close combat, increasing his Melee to d12 and decreasing Agility to d8, and his Prowess determines his Battle Phase as acting 2nd in turn—a dwarf with fast reactions. 

We then work out defense scores. Beraz gets warrior class feats, and race and class advantages. Then it’s a matter of giving him typical gear: a great hammer, chain armor, and a purse of gold. Since he is third level, we add a magic item: a helm equivalent to a small shield (he is very hard-headed). 

As for personality and background, he is a gruff and sturdy former dwarven delve guard off to seek his fortune in the world and sample all possible ales long the way. He knows of a likely treasure hoard under the Iron Crags, but the way is perilous…

 Creature Tropes

Ainerêve’s Eldritch Realms arise from the Meterea (meh-TEHR-ee-ə)—a plane of chaotic ideas woven from humanity’s dreams and collective unconscious. Its energy suffuses every vision in this multiverse. Where belief holds fast, dream-stuff coalesces into the Settled Lands, a stable domain for both magical and mundane denizens, with geography and distances remaining fixed. Where myth splinters or faith wanes, the raw, ever-shifting Unsettled Lands endure—unpredictable and untamed, their distances bending, stretching, and looping in the flux of chaos.

Among the most populous inhabitants are humanoids: from the fecund, bellicose humans to the myriad races of alfar and the cunning goblinoids. Each people springs from Earth’s collective dreaming, forging distinct societies, pantheons, and legends. For the purposes of this chapter, we will call these foundational figures “tropes”, examining their categorization to aid Game Masters in encounter design. A deeper exploration of their unique mythic contexts follows later in this volume.

**The Bestiary of Beings Diverse and Malign** was assembled at the Octocirculi Academy under the direction of Signoret and the scholars of the Guardian’s Guild at Crossroads, with key chapters by Bertrand Forthwind and the eccentric theorist Symon. Although Symon’s “bubble reality” hypothesis proposes countless other realms, this compendium is strictly limited to the creatures empirically documented within the Eldritch Realms themselves. Housed in the Academy’s archives, it remains the definitive reference for every known archetypal denizen born of Meterea’s dream-wrought tapestry.

Though most denizens remain blissfully unaware that their world is dream-wrought, the creatures within this bestiary are no mere fable. They are the living embodiments of Meterea, the raw, unformed substrate of existence and latent narrative potential—the loom upon which all myth, matter, and meaning are drawn.

**Reifiants**

Reifiants—named from Latin res (“thing”) and reification—are rare, legend-forged archetypes crystallized outright from Meterea when collective belief and narrative focus becomes too powerful to deny. They “arrive” fully formed, embodying the Platonic ideal of their kind—alfar, fay, elves, dwarves, goblinoids, giants, gods, or dragons—and then seed their ordinary descendants through procreation. Some even extend their will to spin self-sustaining Volitional Demiplanes. Encounters with Reifiants are momentous, for their mere presence can reshape reality itself.

Lands of Stability and Flux.

Most tales unfold in stable domains—Settled Lands in the Eldritch Realms—where myths anchor Meterea into predictable geography. Bubble Realities are vast, dream-forged universes; Eldritch Realms contrasts these with Unsettled Lands—fluid margins where belief falters and distances bend. Other bubbles use their own terms for stable and fluid regions. Universally, conviction creates stability; fractured faith dissolves reality into responsive flux

**Inklings, Extantars, and Aethelborn**

These beings are parallel manifestations of Meterea, arising through distinct mechanisms rather than stages of development:

	•	**Inklings** are the rawest dream-spirits—flickers of subconscious intent or emotion barely coalesced, inherently unstable and ever-shifting.

	•	**Extantars** are perception-reactive entities whose fluid forms morph with each observer’s expectations and fears. Their being is driven by watching, not by belief, and they remain forever mutable.

	•	**Aethelborn** (Aethelmúr) are stabilized forms—often derived from Extantars—forged by focused external will (divine command, unbreakable oath, or potent artifact). Their fixed identity grants resilience but makes them vulnerable to loopholes or disruptions in their binding.

**• Regular Ainerêve Denizens** are mortals born in the Settled Lands—humans, alfar, dwarves, goblinoids—whose lives obey fixed laws. Though their flesh and culture spring from Meterea’s weaving of humanity’s dreams, stories, motifs, beliefs, and myths, they remain unaware, believing their world inherently real and reinforcing its stability through daily tradition

**Outlanders**

Outlanders are rare souls plucked from Earth by Revorage Rifts—portals yanked open by violent dream storms. Whether a lone individual or a whole village is swept through, their arrival point in Ainerêve mirrors their collective beliefs. In ages past, such arrivals seeded orders like the Templars of Psarmoroum, reshaping the world’s map and history.

Creature Design

For individuals wishing to explore outside the recognized monster listings of the Bestiary, this section offers creature tropes with guidance on creating additional encounter possibilities. While the preceding section on encounters explored the technical aspects of creature creation, here the emphasis moves toward a more general classification so assisting Game Masters flexibility in including these creatures into your game.

Creature Nature Classifications

Based on their natural traits, and physical attributes, creatures in the Eldritch Fantasy Realms are categorized as Mundane, Magical, Preternatural, and Supernatural. These groups help to further define the function of different creatures in the campaign by allowing one to ascertain their degree of strength, relevance, or threat they may present to player characters. 

**Mundane** creatures in Ainerêve fall into two lineages: born natives and Outlanders. Ainerêve-born denizens arrive fully formed through an ongoing, culture-driven stabilization of Meterea rather than a sudden mythic flash. Only ideas that amass extraordinary, widespread belief crystallize into Reifiants; most wildlife, artisans, warriors and common folk instead enter the world by ordinary birth within a Settled Land already anchored by enduring traditions. This self-reinforcing loop of family, custom and local legend smooths out any raw dreamstuff flickers, so they never emerge first as Inklings or fluid Extantars.

Outlanders come intact from Earth, “real by definition” when they burst through Revorage Rifts. They obey rigid terrestrial physics and carry an Earth-shaped mindset that bends nearby dream-currents in ways natives cannot. Their mere presence can warp local reality, serving as sudden catalysts in a world usually governed by slow, collective belief.

Together, these two origins occupy Ainerêve’s “mundane” tier: one a steady, dream-wrought emergence; the other an abrupt, outsider-driven provocation of Meterea

Magical

Magical denizens—from fey and elementals to mortal sorcerers, theurgists, and ritualists—tap into ambient strands of Meterea without fully rewiring reality’s loom. They identify themselves as practitioners of arcane or divine magic, attributing their abilities to elemental forces, sacred pacts, or lineage. While they can conjure illusions, hail fire from the sky, or commune with spirits, they remain fundamentally corporeal—subject to gravity, mortality, and most physical laws. Their gifts spring from craftsmanship and precise resonance with Meterea’s latent potential, not from the mass belief that births fully reified beings.

Preternatural

Preternatural creatures straddle body and mind, forged by nightmare storms, subconscious echoes, or the restless churn of raw dream-stuff in the Unsettled Lands. Undead driven by grief and rage, shapeshifters who wear belief as a skin, and nightmare-spawn that flicker at the edge of perception all qualify. They defy mundane order—walking through walls, warping flesh, oozing dread—yet remain anchored enough to engage physically, each uncanny ability hinting at the deeper, fluid substratum of Ainerêve.

Supernatural Creatures

Supernatural entities are Meterea’s most refined manifestations: gods, dragons, titans, angels, and demons whose very essence springs from persistent myth and collective belief. Though many preside over self-wrought Volitional Demiplanes, those realms are the product of their will, not the source of their power. Often incorporeal or semi-tangible, they brook no mortal laws or lesser magics; wherever their inscrutable agendas unfold, reality itself bends or shatters in their wake.

Creature Tropes Design

Whether you need simple stat blocks for quick encounters or richly detailed denizens that deepen immersion, you can tailor each creature’s design to your campaign’s tone and your players’ preferences. Below are exemplar tropes—each ripe for either streamlined use or expanded into memorable NPCs and adversaries.

**Goblinoids:** Cunning and covetous, goblins and their orcish kin thrive on hoarded wealth and territorial defense. Found in dank caves, ruined fortresses, or shadowed forests, they blend bestial ferocity with reptilian traits—sharp teeth, mottled hides, and predatory eyes. Goblinoid societies center on treasure accumulation, making them both intriguing rivals driven by greed and dangerous foes defending glittering hoards.

**Alfar:** Once a Norse term for elves and fairies, “Alfar” in Ainerêve encompasses a broad family of magical humanoids: elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and their kin. Each race reflects its preferred biome—mountain, meadow, or glade—yet all share a spark of Meterea’s dream-stuff. Elves bear delicate, pointed ears and deep bonds to arcane lore; dwarves combine immense strength with masterful craftsmanship; gnomes delight in inventive trickery and arcane experiments; and halflings charm with nimble grace and irrepressible curiosity.

**Dwarves:** Solid as stone, dwarves carve their strongholds into Grimsete’s peaks, the Sechdraic Mountains of Dalmavand, and the deep halls of the Northern Reaches. Renowned miners and smiths, they prize endurance and precision, forging legendary arms and armor while upholding ancient clan traditions in song, stone, and steel.

**Elves:** Forest-bound and long-lived, elves thrive where nature’s magic is strongest. In Meath Forest, the Seelie under King Oberon welcome travelers with illusions of beauty and wonder. In shadow-haunted groves ruled by Queen Mab, Unseelie elves practice darker arts—necromancy, blood magic, and curses that twist hope into despair.

**Halflings & Gnomes:** Halflings, diminutive yet daring, make their homes in the Fertile Glens, Crossroads, and Avinoble’s sunny lanes. Their mischievous spirit and quick reflexes belie a fierceness when defended hearth and kin. Gnomes, equally small, favor workshops and laboratories, blending whimsical humor with ingenious arcanum to craft marvels both delightful and dangerous.

**Drakkin:** Born of dragons and humans, Drakkin bear scaled hides and wield elemental breath. Whether patrolling Verdant Expanse’s mist-shrouded valleys or navigating Dalmavand’s high passes, they blend human ambition with draconic power—often serving as warrior-scholars, mercenary knights, or enigmatic guardians of draconic lore.

Mundane Creatures

Ordinary denizens of the Settled Lands, shaped by Earth’s dreams but lacking any innate arcane spark. Villagers, bandits, and wild animals can still threaten unwary adventurers—especially in groups or when led by a capable commander.

**Mundane-Minor (1 Threat Die)**

• Villagers (1d4)

• Inexperienced bandits (1d6)

• Small animals (rats 1d3, rabbits 1d4)

**Mundane-Standard (2 Threat Dice)**

• Trained guards (2d6)

• Seasoned brigands (2d8)

• Mid-sized predators (wolves 2d6, bears 2d8)

**Mundane-Exceptional (3 Threat Dice)**

• Veteran warriors (3d8)

• Cunning assassins (3d10)

• Apex predators (tigers 3d10, large cats 3d8)

**Mundane-Legendary (3+ Threat Dice)**

• Renowned champions (3d12+)

• Warlords with retinues (3d12+)

• Colossal beasts (elephants 3d12+, whales 3d12+)

Magical Creatures

Magical denizens draw on ambient Meterea and the primal forces of the Fey Courts or elemental realms, adding an unpredictable spark to any encounter.

	•	**Minor** (1 Threat Die): Pixies (1d4), sprites (1d6), novice druids (1d6), hedge wizards (1d8).

	•	**Standard** (2 Threat Dice): Elven mages and druidic circles (2d8), unicorns (2d10).

	•	**Exceptional** (3 Threat Dice): Powerful sorcerers and archdruids (3d10), griffins (3d8), manticores (3d10).

	•	**Legendary** (3+ Threat Dice): Archmages and fey nobility (3d12+), true dragons (3d12+).

Preternatural Creatures

Preternatural beings straddle the boundary between flesh and psyche, born of nightmare storms, psychic echoes, and the raw churn of Meterea’s undirected dreams. They defy mundane laws while retaining solid form, making them unpredictable and dangerous.

	•	**Minor** (1 Threat Die): Skeletons (1d4), zombies (1d6), doppelgangers (1d8), mimics (1d8)

	•	**Standard** (2 Threat Dice): Vampires (2d8), werewolves (2d10), potent specters (2d10)

	•	**Exceptional** (3 Threat Dice): *Liches (3d10), vampire lords (3d12), ancient shapeshifters (3d10)

	•	**Legendary** (3+ Threat Dice): Undead dragons (3d12+), bound demons (3d12+), legendary shapeshifters (3d12+)

* Liches—and similarly potent foes like vampires lords—remain Preternatural because their power stems from individual mastery of necromantic or arcane rites, not from the collective belief that births Reifiants. They’re undead or warped flesh‐bound entities—terrifying, yes, but still subject to material laws. Only if a lich were raised into living legend by widespread, enduring worship—its very name woven into the world’s myths—would belief itself anchor it as Supernatural. Without that cultural foundation, even the mightiest horror is a star-caught marvel of personal craft, not a myth-forged deity.

Supernatural Creatures

Supernatural creatures are Ainerêve’s pinnacle Reifiants—gods, titans, dragons, angels, and demon lords—drawn into being through the weight of collective myth. Their existence is sustained by enduring worship and narrative focus, granting them a permanence no ritual or mortal law can undo. Though they may forge Volitional Demiplanes, those realms spring from their will rather than fueling it. As living embodiments of archetypes, they ignore mundane and magical limits alike, reshaping reality wherever their inscrutable designs take root.

	•	**Minor** (1 Threat Die): Lesser angels and minor fiends (1d8), local guardian spirits such as dryads or nymphs (1d6)

	•	**Standard** (2 Threat Dice): True angels (2d10), powerful demons (2d12), elder nature spirits with mythic followings (2d10)

	•	**Exceptional** (3 Threat Dice): Archangels (3d10), demon lords (3d12), avatars of minor deities (3d12)

	•	**Legendary** (3+ Threat Dice): Full-fledged gods and goddesses (3d12+), primordial titans and reified cosmic forces (3d12+)Supernatural-Exceptional (3 Threat Dice): Archangels (3d10), demon lords (3d12), avatars of minor deities (3d12).

**Supernatural-Legendary (3+ Threat Dice):** Gods and goddesses (3d12+), primordial beings of immense power (3d12+).

Legendary Creatures

In Eldritch RPG, “Legendary” is strictly a power tier—it applies to any creature, regardless of Nature, that wields three or more Threat Dice in a single attack form and is the only category allowed die ranks above d12 . Legendary foes also tend to boast unique, high-impact abilities and occupy iconic or narrative-central roles, marking them as the most formidable challenges your players can face.

Special Opponent Defenses 

Some foes gain unique defenses from their nature. Fast creatures split their defenses 75% Active / 25% Passive, so any feat that bypasses Active Defense simply fails—they dodge too nimbly. Tough creatures invert that (25% Active / 75% Passive), so Armor-Bypass feats ignore their natural armor and instead chip away at their Passive Hit Points. For example, a tough monster with a 4/10 Active/Passive split (the +2 from leather armor counted in Passive) has 4 Active and 12 Passive HP. An Armor-Bypass attack that would deal 8 points instead drops its Active HP to zero and then subtracts 4 from its Passive pool, leaving 8 Passive HP.

Other special defenses include Ethereal beings, immune to non-magical attacks; Elementals, whose resistances and vulnerabilities follow their element; and unique cases like gargoyles (stone hide) or regenerators (slowly regain HP each round).

**Unplanned Adversaries**

When you need a quick monster on the fly, pick a difficulty—Minor (1 die), Standard (2 dice), or Exceptional (3 dice)—and roll those dice for both its Hit Points and average damage.

For more nuanced foes, use the Threat MV by Dice Combination table. Choose the creature’s attack type (Melee, Natural, Ranged, or Arcane) and dice pool, then look up its Maximum Value (MV) to see the damage potential. From there, calculate HP based on that MV plus any size or nature modifiers.. 

Threat MV by Dice Combination

1. Choose an attack form and dice pool. Decide whether you’re building a Melee, Natural, Ranged, or Arcane attack and what dice (e.g. 2d6, d10+d4) it will roll.

2. Find your dice combination. Under the appropriate Threat tier (Minor, Standard or Exceptional), scan down the column until you locate that exact dice entry.

3. Read the MV range from the first column. The left-most column on the same row gives you the Threat MV Range (e.g. “10–12”). That range represents the attack’s damage potential.

4. Select your Attack MV. Pick a value—often the midpoint or the maximum—in that range to use as your creature’s MV for damage.

5. Determine Hit Points. Use the same Threat tier (Minor → Standard → Exceptional → Legendary) to set base HP, then apply any size- or nature-based multipliers. Apply special defenses. Finally, layer in Fast, Tough, Ethereal, Elemental, or other special traits to reflect how the creature resists or amplifies incoming damage.

Creating a balanced and engaging adventure in Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition requires a careful mix of encounters. The goal is to keep the players on their toes, unsure of what will hit them next. This uncertainty adds to the excitement and tension of the game.

Encounter Difficulty 

As a general rule, you can use a d10 to determine the difficulty of encounters:

1-3: Easy

4-6: Moderate

7-9: Difficult

10: Demanding

This distribution is more challenging and is suitable for games that have fewer encounters per session or for experienced players who enjoy a higher level of difficulty.

Alternatively, for a game that needs to move quickly or for beginner players, you might use this easier distribution:

1-4: Easy

5-7: Moderate

8-9: Difficult

10: Demanding

Formidable encounters should be placed intentionally, often serving as boss fights or climactic moments in the adventure. For example, if you were designing a high-stakes adventure like "The Perilous Depths of Despair", you would likely only assign difficult, demanding, and formidable encounters.

Random Encounters

Wandering monsters or random encounters usually pose lesser threats. Their primary purpose is to consume the party's time and resources if they have been spending too long on their quest. For these encounters, you might use a d6 to determine the difficulty:

1-3: Easy

4-5: Moderate

6: Difficult

Encounter Difficulty Table

_The Defense Level vs. Total Opponent Threat Score Table_ can be a valuable tool for Game Masters to design balanced encounters. It establishes a correlation between the number of player characters (PCs), their collective Defense Level (MV Range), and various encounter threat levels. 

The Defense Level is a cumulative measure of all PCs' Active and Passive hitpoint scores. The threat levels, classified as Easy, Moderate, Difficult, Demanding, Formidable, and Deadly, signify the degree of challenge presented by the encounters. 

This table aids in ensuring that encounters are appropriately challenging, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

**To create a balanced encounter using the table:**

1. Determine the Defense Level range of your party.

2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to the number of PCs in your party.

3. Locate the column in the table that corresponds to the threat level of the encounter.

4. The value in the cell at the intersection of the row and column is the maximum Defense MV for the encounter.

5. Use the threat levels in the table to determine the difficulty of the encounter.

For example, if you have a party of four Level 2 Competent (30-56) characters and you want to create a Difficult Threat encounter, the maximum Defense MV for the encounter would be 96.

To determine the composition of the encounter, subtract the threat values from the appropriate threat level column. Use the MV values to select appropriate opponents, considering the limitations of dice configurations (not exceeding 3d12).

Customize the encounter by selecting minor, standard, or exceptional opponents based on the MV and dice configurations, ensuring they align with the chosen threat level.

Create an engaging and challenging encounter using the determined opponents, considering their abilities, attack dice, and hit points.

Creature Size, Nature, and Encounter Difficulty

When designing encounters for your heroes, you need to balance several factors that affect the difficulty of the encounter. One of these factors is the threat mv score of the creatures, which measures how much damage they can deal and how hard they are to hit. 

Another factor is the hit points of the creatures, which measures how long they can survive in combat. A third factor is the special abilities of the creatures, which can give them an edge over their opponents.

Hit points have a huge impact on the difficulty of an encounter because they determine how many rounds of combat the creatures can last. The more rounds they last, the more damage they can deal and the more chances they have to use their special abilities. The difficulty of an encounter increases exponentially with the hit points, much faster than the rate at which it increases with the threat mv score considered alone.

But hit points are not the only factor that affects the difficulty. Some creatures have abilities that make them more dangerous than others with the same hit points. 

For example, a medium creature that has preternatural abilities increases one step in difficulty than a normal medium creature. 

A large, huge, or gargantuan creature that has preternatural or supernatural abilities (has abilities beyond the physical) is two steps harder than a normal creature of the same size. 

A magical creature may or may not be harder, depending on what kind of magic it can use. Some magic abilities, like extra attacks or breath weapons, make a creature more threatening, but this applies to any creature, not just magical ones. 

Legendary creatures (those with special actions or traits) can also be one step harder, depending on their abilities and the number of heroes.

**Too Tough Rule:** If an opponent's hit points are too high, the GM can reduce them to 1.5 times the party's total maximum threat points per round. This rule is a guideline, not a hard and fast rule, and the GM should use their discretion. The rule is most useful for large, powerful opponents and can be used to balance encounters or create more challenging ones.

Example of Encounter Creation 

**Balancing Threat Against the Party's Defense Level**

The player characters consist of four player adventurers whose combined defensive measures equate to an “advanced” tier. As they ascend, they face a deadly threat. 

Emerging from a hidden cave is a monstrous chimera, its lion, goat, and dragon heads ready to attack. From the shadows slithers a gorgon, its petrifying gaze threatening to turn them to stone. A pair of harpies swoop down from above, and four dire wolves encircle the party.

**_Total Threat Score Calculation_**

Chimera (MV 30): 80

Gorgon (MV 28): 80

Harpies (MV 18 each) x2: 80

Dire Wolves (MV 8 each) x4: 40

**Total Threat Score:** 280 (Deadly Threat for a party with a Defense Level of 280)

The values in parentheses next to the creature's name represent their Maximum Value (MV) for their most potent attack type. In this case:

**Chimera (MV 30):** This means the chimera's highest potential damage output (its most powerful attack) has a maximum value of 30. This is derived from its Melee or Natural attacks, as indicated in its stat block.

**Gorgon (MV 28):** Similarly, the gorgon's most potent attack has a maximum value of 28.

**Harpies (MV 18 each) x2:** Each harpy has a maximum value of 18 for its most potent attack. Since there are two harpies, their combined MV is 36.

**Dire Wolves (MV 8 each) x4:** Each dire wolf has a maximum value of 8 for its most potent attack. With four dire wolves, their combined MV is 32.

The total threat score is then calculated by adding up the MVs of all the creatures in the encounter: 80 (chimera) + 80 (gorgon) + 80 (harpies) + 40 (dire wolves) = 280.

This total threat score is then compared to the Encounter Difficulty Table to determine the encounter's difficulty level for the party. In this case, a total threat score of 280 corresponds to a "Deadly Threat" for a party with a Defense Level of 280. This means the encounter is designed to be very challenging and potentially lethal for the adventurers.

**_Enemy Composition Stats_**

**Chimera (Legendary)**

**TY:** Legendary | **TD**: Melee 2d10, Natural 2d8 | **EA**: 1d8 | **HP**: 80 (20 active / 60 passive) [tough, large, magical; x2] | **DR**: +6 HP (Thick Hide) | **ST**: d12 | **BP**: 8 (d12) | **Special Abilities**: Breath Weapon (2d6 fire), Venomous Fumes (d10)

**Quick Stat Block Examples**

**Quick Stat Blocks (QSB):** Most creatures, whether monsters, animals, or NPCs are categorized as minor, standard, exceptional, or legendary, using the QSB format, aiding in quick play and encounter design. The template includes essential combat attributes like Threat Dice (TD), Extra Attacks (EA), Hit Points (HP), damage reduction (DR), Saving Throw (ST), and Battle Phase (BP). 

A creature's type (Minor, Standard, Exceptional, or Legendary) is determined solely by the quantity of attack dice in its highest Threat Dice (TD) category, disregarding the specific type of dice or their maximum values. Creatures with one attack die are classified as Minor, those with two dice as Standard, and those with three dice as Exceptional. Any (and quite rare) creature possessing three or more attack dice in any category is automatically classified as Legendary, irrespective of its other attributes or capabilities. Quick Stat Blocks streamline combat encounters and can be listed as they are in the beastiary section or in a compact format, as shown below:

 Chapter 9: Arbitration

The game is organized like a reference manual, but fear not, it does not require an eidetic memory; nobody is expected to achieve mastery of rules minutiae. Nor does it assume the use of miniatures and tactical battle mats. Instead, it provides straightforward rules (and a few elaborations) based on simple principles, covering most normal actions and outcomes in the game, letting the GM use common sense in unusual situations. The first rule, though, is to see to the entertainment of all players. The rules are designed to provide a flexible framework that improves gameplay by helping players vividly describe character actions, bringing their ideas to life. 

Once you understand the game's mechanics, they serve the story, eventually fading into the background. The game balances creative player descriptions and the consistency provided by the mechanical rules. It is also easy to tailor the Eldritch RPG rules to suit your group’s unique play style. The more complex game rules can be introduced as and when the group is ready for them. The other design principle is “nothing is impossible,” which is why resolution favors randomization, and we are careful to avoid impossible target numbers and invincible damage resistances.

However, adventurers do have plenty of growth potential. Nothing is impossible given the right tools, skills, and aptitudes.

Hero development through an unfolding story is important and part of the fun of play. If at a disadvantage by lacking a certain spell or combat maneuver or magic item, the heroes can seek higher knowledge, develop greater puissance, and quest for mightier artifacts. 

Game Balance

In a tabletop role-playing game, how is game balance determined? At its most basic level, game balance refers to rules that promote fair and enjoyable play sessions for all parties engaged, with the Game Master as the arbiter. 

Game balance relates to all players' contributing meaningfully to the success of an adventure session, whether in combat, exploration, or interactions with creatures encountered. The Plyphyny rules underpin the Eldritch 2nd Edition game and are created with the author’s preferences in mind. 

Even so, mathematical equilibrium in all parts of the play is not the Holy Grail. Without considering the many possible milieux, the baseline for character power and effectiveness is arbitrary. The character concepts in this game are tropes, presented more narratively than mathematically. 

As such, any standard class and race combination costs between 70–96 character points, and are not all equal in character point cost, as any curious gamer with a calculator will discover. But players may want to create their own variation, and so guidelines for this are given below.

Custom Characters

The abilities of the Eldritch RPG in this 2nd Edition revolve around Fortitude, Competence, and Prowess. In essence, if broken down into the three archetypes of Rogue, warrior, and wizard, the feats and powers include everything the other classes do (i.e., assassins are a sub-type of rogue). A player can achieve that with just those three classes as a starting point. Each race and class ties well with a specific stat; Warrior to Fortitude, Rogue to Prowess, and wizard to Competence.

Eldritch has allowed players to create anything they want but with some guidelines. If custom characters are allowed in the game, or creatures featuring the Mythic Physiology advantage, like the Drakkin, then treat all characters as essentially custom, and grant even the regular combinations of race and class an extra 10 character points to spend (so a human or elf would get 20 CPs not just 10). 

With a warrior, the player knows the focus is on combat; with a mage, it’s magic, and with rogue, it’s utility or support. The specifics of their rogue, warrior, or wizard are then up to the player. Just like the assassin feats can go into the rogue archetype, all magic-related feats go into the wizard archetype, and so on. Wizards have access to all spell-like powers. Warriors get access to all combat-like feats, and rogues get access to all the utility feats. This is how customized characters are created.

Players can choose one of the three archetypes and choose feats and advantages or innate race/species flaws from those listed below. They may choose 4 feats from one archetypal list or two from each of two different archetype lists for unusual combinations.

• Warrior, Rogue, or wizard + 10 CPs for a custom class.

• Existing race + 10 CPs for a custom race.

• Mythic race (Drakkin or others in Ainerêve setting book incorporating the Mythic physiology advantage) + 10 Cps (plus 10 CPs to player characters of normal races).

• 80 CPs for complete customization.

Players who want to play a more tribal/barbarian-like character, for example, can choose the warrior class and focus on the brawn/rage/survival stuff. Alternatively, they may decide to play a knight-like character instead and focus on weaponry, armor, and shield feats and skills.

Alternative Focuses of Expertise 

The focus areas as described are the tip of the iceberg for customization. The areas provided represent the most commonly used areas of knowledge or skill in the game, but players may collaborate with GMs to further customize their characters further, adding new focuses at the regular cost granting bonuses to specific situations. 

Focus areas are either non-combat or combat-oriented and will add a bonus to either an ability check, potential harm, or initiative. Most often it is Competence → Expertise that’s easiest to expand, with endless possibilities in areas of knowledge: Diplomacy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Military Tactics, Religion, History/Lore, and so on.

Pick four feats from one list or two feats from two separate lists.

Focus Swaps 

When creating a character, players have the option to swap their racial focus bonus for a focus bonus related to one of the base minimum specialties of their chosen class. 

This allows characters to further customize their abilities and better align their focus bonus with their chosen class. If the chosen class has more than one base minimum specialty, the player can choose to swap the racial focus bonus for a focus bonus related to any of these specialties. 

If the chosen class has only one base minimum specialty, the player has two options: he or she can choose a focus that is not already granted by the class, or take a 4-point discount on another focus, spend an additional 4 points, and raise it to +2.

Archetype feats and advantages

Choose 4 feats from one archetypal list or two from two different lists.

Warrior 

Fortitude • Battle Savvy • Berserk • Brawl • Feat of Strength • Grapple • Maneuvers • Stunning Reversal • Sunder Foe

Wizard

Collaborating with the GM

Eldritch RPG's character creation system is designed to be flexible, allowing players to combine various abilities, specialties, and focuses to create unique and powerful characters. Players who wish to work with their Game Master (GM) to create new content, such as races, species, classes, or a combination of these elements, will find detailed guidelines in this chapter to ensure that new content integrates seamlessly with the game's existing mechanics.

To further customize their characters, players can select new focus areas that provide bonuses in specific situations. Players can collaborate with their GM to create additional focus areas, as long as they adhere to the game's structured cost and bonus rules. 

Example Classes:

**Archer:** Uses Prowess to enhance Precision, focusing on Ranged Threat and Ranged Finesse to attack from a distance. Archers can select feats from the Warrior list or collaborate with the GM to develop custom feats.

**Bard:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Wizardry, and Adroitness with a customized focus on Musicianship to cast spells and perform music, aiming to support and control crowds.

**Beastmaster:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Animal Handling and Perception with a custom focus on Nature Awareness, forming bonds with animals to command them in battle and navigate the wilderness.

**Chronomancer:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Willpower and Wizardry with a custom focus on Temporal Manipulation, and Competence to enhance Expertise with an Arcanum advantage to manipulate the flow of time, slowing enemies or accelerating allies.

**Paladin:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Endurance and Willpower, and Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Theurgy, smiting foes and healing allies, specializing in holy magic and righteous combat.

**Runesmith:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Artifice and Perspicacity with a custom focus on Rune Lore to create and use powerful runic artifacts, blending magic and craftsmanship.

**Sentinel:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Strength, and Competence to enhance Perception with a focus on Alertness to detect and respond to danger, specializing in defense and protecting allies.

**Shadowmancer:** Uses Prowess to enhance Agility with a custom focus on Shadow Manipulation and Competence to enhance Expertise with an Arcanum advantage to control shadows and darkness, using them for stealth, deception, and attacks.

**Spirit Whisperer:** Uses Willpower to enhance Concentration with a custom focus on Spirit Communication and Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Theurgy to communicate with and command spirits, leveraging their knowledge and power.

**Stormcaller:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Elementalism and Adroitness with a custom focus on Weather Manipulation to command the forces of nature, summoning storms and wielding elemental powers.

**Swashbuckler:** Uses Prowess to enhance Agility with a focus on Reaction and Speed, and Competence to enhance Adroitness for performing acrobatic feats and daring combat moves.

**Tactician:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Strategizing, and Competence to enhance Perception and Perspicacity to devise battle strategies and anticipate enemy movements, specializing in tactical planning and coordination.

Example Races:

**Bestian (humanoid mammal):** Ability ranks begin with Competence at d6 and Prowess at d8, enhanced by Agility and Speed. Advantages include Animal Affinity, Mythic Physiology (claws or fangs), Empathic abilities, and Strong-Willed traits.

**Goblin:** Ability ranks start with Competence at d4 advancing to Adroitness at d6 with bonuses in Skulduggery and Cleverness, and Prowess at d6. Advantages include being Expeditious, possessing Mythic Vision adapted to darkness, a natural Sense of Direction in caves, and Survival skills.

**Kobold:** Starts with Competence at d4, advancing to Perception at d6, with bonuses in Alertness and Perspicacity, and Prowess at d6. Advantages include the ability to Read Emotions, innate Intuitive cunning, and robust Survival skills.The Effects of MagicDelve into the mystical realm of spellcasting as we explore the foundations of game spells and power effects, designed for advanced GMs and players eager to improvise or forge new spells. Magic effects comprise six categories: Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore (and its inverse Destroy), each hosting specific associated spells. 

**Activate** covers eclectic spells that escape categorization, including temporary powers, divine favor, non-combat spells, and enhanced luck. 

**Afflict** encompasses spells inducing negative status effects like confusion, mind control, and paralysis. 

**Harm** effects are magical attacks that deliver threat points, bypass defensive measures such as armor and active defense points, or amplify the potential harm. 

**Modify** effects enhance or curse abilities or equipment, ranging from weapon augmentation to enemy cursing. 

Protect effects consist of magical shielding, armor, protective walls, and immunities, proving invaluable for defensive and support characters. 

**Restore** spells remedy injuries, cure diseases, alleviate fatigue, rejuvenate the soul, and can even resurrect the dead, while **Destroy** effects unleash devastating consequences, such as obliteration or disintegration of objects or beings.

Wizards (mages or adepts) and theurgists (priests or druids) tap into distinct magical sources but may evoke similar spell manifestations. Wizards wield arcane energy to command preternatural forces, whereas theurgists direct divine or spiritual power via connections to deities or nature. Irrespective of power origin, mortals are incapable of countering spells cast by gods or avatars without legendary means or immense sacrifice, as divine beings possess power surpassing mortal boundaries. 

Magic’s potency hinges on the wielder’s skill and ingenuity rather than the source. The challenge rating of a spell or magic effect dictates the bonus, change, modification, or increase/decrease in die size steps: d4 (±1), d6 (±2), d8 (±3), d10 (±4), and d12 (±5).

Spell Potency, Challenge and Rarity

**Potency Level 1:** d4 / Common 

**Potency Level 2:** d6 / Uncommon 

**Potency Level 3:** d8 / Esoteric 

**Potency Level 4:** d10 / Occult 

**Potency Level 5:** d12 or above / Legendary 

**Activate**

An Activation is a miscellaneous effect that causes something to exist, or an event to happen, utilizing magic not otherwise covered. 

This includes the generation, dismissal, or manipulation of substances or energies (elemental spells), the summoning or translocation of creatures or objects (as with conjuring spells), or an effect set off by a contingent circumstance (which falls under various categories of ritual magic and magic Magic). 

Boon

A boon is any activation effect that grants a person or group some general advantage in dangerous or challenging situations. 

Such spells represent magic spells of utility, expeditiousness, or convenience to the heroes. For example, hastened travel through difficult terrain, the ability to breathe underwater, or the favor of the gods in battle (see spell listings for examples).

Summoning

This activation effect allows a magic practitioner to summon creatures from common beasts to demons and elementals, banish said creatures to another dimension, forcibly teleport a victim elsewhere, conjure or dismiss an object, or even open rifts for travel by “summoning” named places. 

A basic summoning spell calls some specific object or creature type per round, each incurring separate spell maintenance penalties. The range is the line of sight, up to Competence die MV × 2 in feet. The test can be modified by the size and magical nature of some creatures, as below. 

The summoner can banish a monster under his control without effort. However, if he loses control over a summoned creature, a battle of wills ensues (relevant magic-based ability branch versus the monster’s main attack: its highest threat dice). 

Summon Creature 

The creature materializes at the chosen destination point (which must be a safe place to manifest, or the creature gets an immediate special saving throw to break the spell: summoned dice value vs. the spell roll). After the first round, a summoned creature gets to roll its highest threat dice every round versus the caster’s Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or relevant magic-based ability branch, whichever the player prefers, to break free of the spell. If the conjured creature wins the contest, it vanishes or may attack the caster (GM’s discretion).

The basic ability test to summon a creature depends on its type, as below. The penalty is applied if the summoning fails. 

**Creature type /** examples / difficulty / penalty 

**• Minor:** cat, rat, bat / d4 / spell fizzles

**• Standard:** goblin, human / d6 / –1 spirit points

**• Exceptional:** manticore, gargoyle / d10+2 / –2 spirit points

**• Legendary:** giant, dragon / d12+2 / –3 spirit points

**Modifiers for Summoning Spells**:

Offsetting these modifiers may require spirit points’ expenditure, costing one spirit point per nullified penalty point. Note that some creatures are impossible to summon improvisationally without powerful assistive magic (as determined by the GM). 

Apply –1 to the ability test for each threat rank above 4 (applied to all threat dice equally), up to –5 penalty. Hit points are determined as per the rules in the Game Mastering section, Encounters. 

**Size Modifiers:**

**• Large:** -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points doubled.

**• Huge:** -2 penalty on the ability test, hit points tripled.

**• Gargantuan:** -3 penalty on the ability test, hit points quadrupled.

**Nature Modifiers:**

**• Magical:** -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points doubled.

**• Preternatural:** -2 penalty on the ability test, hit points tripled.

**• Supernatural:** -3 penalty on the ability test, hit points quadrupled.

If a creature’s challenge die is at its maximum, such as a 3d12 for a supernatural demon, the penalties from size and nature are consolidated and then divided by the number of threat dice to adjust the summoning challenge accordingly.

**Example**: Consider the summoning of a medium-sized, supernatural demon with 3d12 threat dice. The base challenge for this summoning is d10+2, increased by +3 due to the creature's supernatural nature, culminating in a d10+5 challenge for the summoning roll. Once summoned, the creature’s attempts to break free of the spell’s control commence from the second round onward. 

Each round, the demon rolls its highest threat dice against the caster’s chosen magic-based focus area, like Fortitude or Willpower, to escape control. To mitigate the risk of the demon breaking free, the caster can use spirit points to offset the demon's escape attempts. For each round, one spirit point can be spent to reduce the demon's threat dice by one level, thereby increasing the caster's chances of maintaining control. 

Swarm Summoning

A summoner can also choose to cast a swarm summoning, conjuring multiple very weak creatures, whether a horde of imps or a swarm of bees. The number of creatures summoned is equal to 2 × the MV of the challenge die chosen, and each creature has 1 threat point and 1 hit point. The creatures act as one group, with initiative equal to the caster’s Expertise rank. Swarms are always instinct-driven, and while able to follow simple commands, they never possess real intelligence or significant equipment. 

Swarm ability test = d4 through d12. 

A standard spell maintenance penalty kicks in on the second round, determined by the original test. The summoner can command a swarm or minion horde to attack in the same round they appear. The spell operates much like a regular area effect Harm spell, with the swarm attacking as many targets as it can surround, but unlike such a spell, the swarm damage is divided among those trapped by the summoned attackers. That means one defender caught takes the full brunt, but many take less potential harm since the attackers are split between defenders.• 

Banish Summoned Creature

Banishment requires exceeding the test roll needed to summon the targeted creature. Success means the summoning is broken, and the creature will vanish. 

Any failed attempt to banish a summoned creature also allows it an immediate saving throw to break free of the original summoner’s command. All practitioners of magic know when a summoned creature under their command is subject to an attempt to banish it.

Ritualized Creature Summoning

The ritual summoning of creatures increases spell duration and does not incur maintenance penalties but rather requires a focus object that must not be broken during the intended duration. 

The amount of time required to perform a ritual is equal to its desired duration. The summoned creature can attempt to break free after each multiple of that duration (the creature rolls its highest threat die rank versus the magic-wielder’s Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or Competence → Expertise → Wizardry ability branch, as the player prefers). 

Therefore, a ritual requiring two rounds to summon a goblin lets the goblin attempt to escape after every two rounds (so it could be free on the third). However, if it remains controlled for three months, the conjured creature becomes a permanent resident of the summoner’s settled land. After that, the creature may attempt to break free of the spell once a year or if forced into suicidal actions. If successful, the creature may attack or return to its home plane or wander at will.

Summon Object

Objects conjured for entertainment, like a colorful explosion of flowers, or small harmless items, are handled via common cantrips (automatic or d4). Sometimes the GM may allow an automatic success with a cantrip if not casting a spell under duress. 

Conjured objects are not illusory; each will have the expected mass and weight and possess structural hit points in that general range (GM decides). Such creation is not ex nihilo, but instead pulling an object from near or far (even if whereabouts are unknown). Summoned objects materialize where desired within an allowable range if the space is free of any creature or solid object. They remain so long as the spell is maintained. These objects will be as envisioned, e.g., lamps will be lit and filled with oil if so desired. The summoned objects can also be used as a means of attack, within limits, say, by dropping an anvil out of the sky (see Conjured Items as Hazards). 

The object is normally one of the following: one piece of regular armor, a weapon, a container, tool, wheeled vehicle, or mount, a plant, money (copper, silver, gold, platinum, mithral, gems), one ration, or clothes. Objects must be mundane and common to the experiences of the average adventurer. Ignorance of how an item works will not hinder the effectiveness of a conjuration spell. For example, if someone conjures a padlock it will work (so long as he conjures a key to accompany it). He does not need to be a locksmith to do this. 

Of course, this leads to interesting questions; how hard would the lock be to pick? What if he wants to create a silver dagger rather than one made of steel? How heavy is a conjured boulder? How much money can a magic-wielder create out of thin air? These sorts of questions are answerable with impromptu GM arbitration, but there are general standardized parameters. The challenge dice and modifiers for object summoning are as follows, on the Object Summoning Difficulty table:

_Object Summoning difficulty_

**• d4:** Minuscule (up to 5 oz), e.g., ring, mug; orTiny (up to 5 lb), e.g., coconut, breadbox. 


**• d6:** Small (up to 50 lb), e.g., saddle, chair. 

**• d8:** Medium (up to 300 lb), e.g., anvil, desk. 

**• d10:** Large (up to 2,500 lb), e.g., boulder, wagon. 

**• d12:** Huge (up to 25,000 lb), e.g., boulder, siege engine. 

**• d12+2:** Gargantuan (up to 50,000 lb), e.g., boulder, small ship. 

_Object summoning ability test modifiers_

• –1 per 50 coins worth of precious metals or gems.

• –2 for a set of related objects (e.g., clothing, armor, bag of coins).

• –2 per 10 feet above target (for dropping objects in attack).

• –4 for complex objects with moving parts or gears.

Conjured Items as Hazards 

When a conjured item is made to fall from the sky or to materialize in a motion that could impact someone, such usage is generally handled like a standard attack spell where damage is determined by the attack roll. For further refinement and additional details, the rules found in the Hazards section of Chapter 7 should be consulted. In instances where an object is falling, damage should be calculated based on both the size of the object and its height above the target. 

The following guidelines are suggested for damage based on every 10 feet of fall: Small objects: 4 threat points. Medium objects: 6 threat points.Large objects: 8 threat points. Huge objects: 10 threat points.Gargantuan objects: 12 threat points.These threat points should be applied up to a maximum fall distance of 100 feet, to acknowledge the impact limit imposed by terminal velocity. Beyond this height, no additional damage should be accrued. 

For defense against these hazards, characters can apply their Fortitude-based points to reduce damage before it impacts their hit points. This reflects their ability to potentially withstand or mitigate the impact to some degree.

**Indirect Attacks vs. Direct Hazards:** For indirect attacks like rolling boulders or toppling doors, which typically cause less damage than direct drops, they remain harder to avoid. Consequently, the threat points for these are the same as direct impacts, though no saving throw is allowed, which underscores their unpredictability and immediate danger.

Ritualized Object Summoning 

Items conjured by ritual do not incur maintenance penalties but rather become the spell’s focus objects and remain in existence for the spell’s duration. A tiny or bigger object requires one round to cast per challenge die increase (see above). 

The preparation time used in the ritual determines the frequency of the conjuration’s renewal requirement. If the magic-wielder spends two rounds to conjure a small wagon, they must perform the ritual every third round.

Teleportation

Teleportation per se is like summoning but usually involves magic recipients sending themselves, other creatures, or objects somewhere else. 

**Note**: Mortals cannot generally perform such a feat in Ainerêve, this sort of effect being the province of the gods or supernatural beings there. 

The place where creatures or objects are sent must be in sight, visited before, or studied extensively in books and accurately envisioned. Successful teleportation to a place inaccurately envisioned may result in going astray by 2d6 miles. Teleporting to the wrong place is immediately intuited if the magic-wielderhas visited the place before. 

There is also the option to teleport the unwilling to unsafe locations, near or far: this allows saving throws. 

Creatures teleported away against their will are permitted an opposed roll every round of the encounter to break the spell’s power. Success means the banishment is ended, and the one affected returns to the very spot occupied before he was whisked away by magic. Failure to save means the creature remains stuck, and the next save at a penalty of –2, and so on until there is no escape. If a saving throw becomes impossible, the spell no longer needs to be maintained, and the affected creature remains where it was sent.

**Teleportation difficulty** 

**• Challenge d8:** Teleportation of self or another willing creature, or small objects, only short distances (distance traveled is default range: up to 10 × basic tier MV in feet). 

**• Challenge d10:** Teleportation of creatures (including self) or up to medium-sized objects, up to base ability MV in number, up to miles equaling the branch MV. One test covers all affected.

**• Challenge d12:** Actual personal travel to other planes of existence for self and other willing creatures (including carried objects), up to base ability MV in number. Unwilling creatures get a saving throw each round (with an increasing penalty) and must be maintained until the affected cannot possibly win an opposed roll. 

_Teleport Attuned Items_ 

A magic practitioner can summon a unique existing item to their hands if they have owned it for at least one lunar cycle and have carved their sigil into it. The distance determines the test according to the teleportation (not summoning) rules. Attuned objects can include branded horses and wagons engraved with the sigil (see Attunement Sigil, under Wards & Runes in the Arcanum chapter), allowing for a traveling party’s mass teleportation. Attuned items stay once summonedTeleport Attuned Items 

A magic practitioner can summon a unique existing item to their hands if they have owned it for at least one lunar cycle and have carved their sigil into it. The distance determines the test according to the teleportation (not summoning) rules. 

Attuned objects can include branded horses and wagons engraved with the sigil (using ritual magic → Wards →Attunement Sigil), allowing for traveling parties' mass teleportation. Attuned items stay once summoned.

**Afflict**

Affliction effects are magical effects that can override a target’s free will or cause permanent changes to its mental, spiritual, or physical state, requiring an opposed roll against the caster’s ability test. They can be used in creature powers, NPC abilities, and traps. Defense scores cannot block Affliction effects, and only saving throws can resist them. These effects can stun, slow, distract, incapacitate, or magically control the mind or body. Any affliction caused by an _instant_ spell lasts for one round unless the specific spell description states otherwise.

Saving Throws

Saving throws against Affliction effects let characters use skills, luck, and abilities to avoid, counter, or reduce harmful conditions. 

_Cognitive_ saving throws protect a character’s judgment from mental manipulation and illusions. 

_Skillful_ saving throws help characters avoid or evade physical threats beyond active defense hit points. 

_Valorous_ saving throws resist poisons or let one break free from a villains’ magical commands.

Lingering or Permanent Conditions

Affliction effects can also cause persistent status conditions, such as pain and fatigue, that impede a character’s abilities even after the affliction’s primary cause has ended. To handle these effects, the following guidelines can be implemented: 

**Recovery:** Determine the natural healing rate for each ongoing effect, taking into account factors such as the character’s overall health and the severity of the affliction. 

**Remedies:** For each effect, identify appropriate treatments such as healing spells or medical procedures. Determine their effectiveness with ability tests. The rules allow for customization and the addition of new focuses. For example, a Competence → Expertise + Medicine focus might grant bonuses to ability tests related to administering medical treatment. 

**Long-term consequences:** Consider any permanent injuries or penalties that may result from ongoing effects. Players may collaborate with GMs to use existing flaws or introduce new flaws that reflect lingering or permanent conditions resulting from afflictions. These flaws grant extra Character Points that can be used elsewhere. 

Game Masters should aim for a balance between realism and playability when creating consequences for afflictions. This means avoiding excessive bookkeeping or overly punishing consequences while ensuring that the consequences make sense within the narrative. Ongoing effects from afflictions can provide immersive gameplay experiences that challenge players and serve as a reminder to avoid future afflictions.

Physical Afflictions

**Slow (Challenge d4):** Reduce the target’s initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one full step, for example, from d10 to d8). Increase the difficulty of the magic-wielder’s test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced accordingly.

**Knock Prone or Knock Back (Challenge d6):** The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back, depending on the spell or feat used. For spells, knockback distance is determined by the caster’s Willpower die rank in feet, reflecting their control over magical energy (e.g., 1d8 feet for a d8 Willpower). For feats, knockback may be based on the attacker’s Strength die rank. A successful save avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the target ends within another creature’s reach.

**Stun (Challenge d8):** The target may not move or attack for one full round. It is considered temporarily incapacitated and may be more vulnerable to certain effects or attacks.

**Debilitate Sense (Challenge d10):** Cause total blindness or hearing loss, meaning most Competence → Perception checks using that sense automatically fail (GM's discretion; compensating for the loss may allow a roll with a –5 penalty). This effect can severely hinder the target's ability to interact with their surroundings or detect threats.

**Paralyze (Challenge d12+1):** The target is physically immobilized and loses access to any defense points but can still use innate aptitudes or cast spells with no somatic components (see Spells without Gesture or Word). It is unable to move or perform physical actions.

**Incapacitate (Challenge d12+2):** The target becomes unconscious, falls to the ground, and is vulnerable to attack. The saving throw required to resist this effect is based on Fortitude. Attacks on incapacitated targets bypass defense points and shields, directly reducing the target’s Fortitude. However, armor may still provide protection during general melee encounters. 

Mental Afflictions 

**Distract (Challenge d4):** This spell renders the target indecisive and uncoordinated, disrupting their ability to cast spells and perform complex actions effectively. The reduction in the target's initiative is calculated by dividing the caster's ability test roll by six, rounding up the result. This reduction directly impacts the target’s Prowess die rank or battle phase, thereby slowing their response time and affecting their order of action in combat scenarios.

**Confuse (Challenge d6):** The disoriented target struggles to focus on actions, disrupting concentration and hindering abilities. If engaged in close combat, he or she triggers an opportune attack unless using tactical withdrawal. Unable to attack until the same battle phase next round, he or she can move, support, or help in other ways. This subeffect is more severe than ‘Distract,’ potentially incapacitating or causing unpredictable actions.

**Terrorize (Challenge d8):** The target is stricken with fear, may not attack the magic wielder, and will run for its life until the next battle phase next round. If anyone (even the caster) stands in its way, though, it will attack him or her to try to get past. If those standing in the way of the fleeing creature are allies, an immediate Fortitude → Willpower save is allowed to prevent the creature from trying to violently force its way past. 

**Influence Mind (Challenge d10+1):** The caster can manipulate the target’s thoughts, emotions, or perceptions, causing it to experience altered beliefs, emotions, or sensory input. This subeffect allows for a variety of mental manipulations, such as implanting suggestions, altering memories, or creating illusions.

**Dominate Mind (Challenge d12+2):** Grants the caster total control over a target’s body and mind. Victims may be forced to attack friends or perform unwilling tasks. This effect represents extreme mental control. 

**Harm**

The Harm magic effect enables spellcasters to inflict physical harm on a target using various magical means, such as elemental spells, wizardry, theurgy, and psychic attacks. A basic magical attack with the Harm effect targets a single creature within the caster’s line of sight and maximum range. The mage rolls the relevant ability branch dice for threat points. To overcome a target’s passive defense, the spell’s Harm energy must penetrate active defense hit points. Armor may mitigate or block residual damage, while some spells can bypass armor or active defense (see page 75). 

Harm Spell Challenge 

A zero-challenge Harm spell is a standard attack roll and thus requires no test. Such a magical attack inflicts potential harm equal to the relevant ability branch dice. To increase the threat points of a Harm effect, casters must perform an ability test against a challenge die. If successful, the spell inflicts additional harm, but even if it fails, the basic potential harm still occurs. The table below shows the challenge die and corresponding threat point increase:

**Challenge die d4:** +1 threat point.

**Challenge die d6:** +2 threat points.

**Challenge die d8:** +3 threat points.

**Challenge die d0:** +4 threat points.

**Challenge die d12:** +5 threat points.

Magical Ranged Attack Forms

**Bolt:** Appears as a missile of some substance or a visible effect up to 1 foot in diameter that streaks towards the target (e.g., an ice spear or glowing ball). 

**Burst (area effect):** Burst attack spells usually appear as a bolt that expands or explodes on reaching the targeted point. The area affected is usually the radius of ability branch MV ×2 in feet, double that for mastered spells. A cubic volume will be up to 2 × basic tier MV in feet for height, width, and depth, double that for mastered spells. An area effect spell increases the test by one die rank. If a spell’s failure was associated with an area effect spell in a burst effect or area of effect (2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy Bonus MV, radius), then creatures within the radius take half threat point damage. 

**Stream:** A continuous line of effect up to 2 feet wide originating from the caster (e.g., an arc of flame). 

Non-Physical Potential Harm 

The distinction between parrying, blocking, or dodging is narrative, determined through Game Master and player collaboration during action sequences. As such, although a player would not describe use of active defense points as ‘parrying or blocking’ an intangible bolt of energy, the character could technically dodge, and in terms of game mechanics the active defense points are reduced in the same way. 

Intangible, Non-lethal Attacks 

However, some manifestations of spell energy negate various defenses. Unblockable by ordinary shields or swords, they require a minimum challenge die of d8. Some non-lethal, non-physical attacks subdue rather than kill, such as illusory threat points, which are mitigated by a successful saving throw before affecting passive defense. This mode can render targets unconscious but not take them below below zero passive defense. 

Invisible, Intangible Attacks 

Invisible and intangible psychic attacks, another form of non-physical harm, target the victim’s mind or spirit directly, bypassing physical defenses. These attacks may induce mental or emotional distress, manipulate thoughts, or even cause debilitating pain. 

Invisible spell energies can be challenging to detect or defend against, often requiring specialized magical defenses, heightened perception, or innate psychic resistance. Despite their intangible nature, some psychic attacks can still be evaded or resisted by a target’s mental fortitude or innate ability to counter psychic energy. 

Certain classes can use the Magic Defense advantage to defend against intangible magical 

attacks (see page 187 and page 87). 

Defense Negation

Defense negation is a powerful tool in a spellcaster’s arsenal, allowing the caster to bypass a target’s defenses at the cost of 1 spirit point for every die rank of the spell’s final challenge rating. If the caster does not have enough spirit points to pay for defense negation, he or she cannot use this ability.

**Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1-5 Spirit points):** The spell can negate the target's armor up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die for this effect is equal to the armor's die rank, making the spell's effectiveness contingent on the strength of the target’s armor.

**Bypass Shield (d8 to d12; 3–5 spirit points):** The spell negates the opponent’s physical or magical shield up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = d8/d10/d12 for a small/medium/large shield, with a spirit point cost of 3/4/5 respectively.

**Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1–5 spirit points):** The spell can negate the target’s armor up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = the armor die, with a spirit point cost of 1 per rank (1 at d4 up to 5 at d12).

**Bypass Active Defense (d12; 5 spirit points):** The spell negates the target’s active defense up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = d12 with a spirit point cost of 5.

For all forms of defense negation Harm subeffects, a spell created with the subeffect alone can be maintained to keep the target vulnerable to subsequent attacks from others until the maximum duration, following the universal spell maintenance rules.

Collateral Hazards of Magic

Latent hazards are secondary consequences that occur when a spell interacts with particular materials or conditions. A spell’s latent hazard only activates if the target’s protection is vulnerable to the manifestation. However, objects and vulnerable materials may still be affected or damaged by area effect spells. As a rule of thumb, the GM may add +2 threat points for such interactions. However, the most potent activation of such a hazard can be triggered by a player character rolling the maximum value on the mastery die (when that option is invoked) or when using an iconic magical focus. Examples of collateral hazards include: 

**Magical Combustion:** Flammable objects in the area may ignite due to the spell, causing larger fires and damage to structures or additional targets. Single-target effects include ongoing damage from burning clothing or gear. 

**Enchantment Weakening:** Area effects may damage enchanted structures or objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects may weaken or break magical armor or gear. 

**Fragile Object Shatter / Mystical Air Disruption:** Area effects may shatter delicate objects and cause difficulty breathing or concentrating due to mystical air disturbances, while single-target effects may break fragile items and affect the target’s breathing or concentration. 

**Arcane Shock / Ground Tremor:** Area effects may cause muscle contractions or arcane energy surges, making the ground unstable. Single-target effects may knock the target prone or cause muscle contractions or arcane energy disruptions. 

**Armor Ignition / Magical Force:** Area effects may cause discomfort or additional damage to creatures wearing enchanted metal armor or hurl unsecured objects with magical force. Single-target effects may cause discomfort, additional damage, or knock the target prone. 

**Modify**

The Modify effect allows a spellcaster to modify the target creature’s attributes or abilities. This could be to modify attack potential, transform victims or allies into other creatures to either benefit or severely hinder, transmorph objects, augment senses or natural abilities, and so on.

Modify Vulnerability

The Modify Vulnerability subeffect allows spell crafters to create spells that bypass shields, active defenses, or armor, either as an inherent property of the spell formula or as optional casting modifiers for increased flexibility. It can be combined with a Harm effect to enhance the potency of an attack spell by bypassing defenses that may not have been vulnerable to non-physical or intangible energies. 

Up to six variations of vulnerability can be incorporated into a spell, individually or in combination, enabling even materials and armor types that are not normally vulnerable to specific types of damage to become susceptible.

**Armor Negation:** Challenge equal to armor die-rank. 

**Shield Negation:** Ability test penalty of –1 to –3; added only as a spell modifier option. 

**Active Defense Negation:** Minimum challenge of d8 to eliminate descriptive blocking or parrying possibilities, d10 to eliminate blocking, parrying, or evading, and d12 to eliminate dodging and leaping out of the way. 

Incur Material Vulnerability

This targets specific materials or armor weaknesses, making them more susceptible to a chosen magical manifestation. The Modify Vulnerability subeffect can trigger latent hazards if the caster’s Expertise rank is equal to or greater than the spell’s Challenge Rank. These hazards inflict potential harm equal to the spell’s Challenge Rank and can be triggered by rolling the maximum value on the caster’s mastery die or by using an iconic magical focus.

**Heating or Freezing:** Area effects can freeze or melt objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects can cause ongoing damage from freezing or melting. Additionally, area effects can ignite flammable objects, resulting in larger fires and damage to structures or other targets, whereas single-target effects can cause continuous harm due to burning clothing or equipment. 

**Weakening (or Embrittling):** Area effects may damage structures or objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects may weaken or break armor or gear. 

**Sundering (Shattering, Ripping, Tearing, Crumbling, or Fragmenting):** Potential harm equal to Challenge Rank. Area effects may break fragile objects and cause damage to structures, while single-target effects may break, tear, or shatter armor or gear.

Transmogrify 

Creature Shapeshift 

**Transmute Creature (d8; 3 SP):** The caster can alter hair and skin color and texture, height, weight, and gender within the caster or target species' norms. 

**Shapeshift (d10; 4 SP):** Can change size (in the range tiny, small, medium); alter type into goblinoid, animal, aquatic, or vermin. (Add +2 challenge per change in a size outside the given range.) 

The target gains any racial abilities; height, weight, and gender are under caster control but must fall within the new form’s norms. Equipment held or worn melds into form, reappearing when the effect ends. The caster can know one form per specialty die rank, unless the new form is improvised, costing a Spirit Point.

**Greater Shapeshift (d12; 5 SP):**A shapeshifting master can transform into any living being at will, from a mouse to a dragon, shifting once per round as long as the spell is maintained. The recipient of this power can transform into a giant or legendary beast, changing its size to large, huge, or even gargantuan. The target gains all of the form’s physical special attacks and defenses but does not gain modifiers to overall hit points based on the form’s size or nature. 

**Transform (d12+2; 6 SP):** The target gets all of the form's physical special attacks and defenses, and for a short time, they also get the size or nature-based HP or defense bonuses. This effect can also turn another creature in sight into something inanimate, like stone or another hard substance, making it helpless until the spell is broken. Allows a saving throw if the target is resisting. 

Note: If the caster wishes to grant the target size or nature-based HP or defense bonuses, they must add a +4 challenge modifier for each bonus type applied (e.g., +4 for size-based HP, +4 for nature-based defense). The base number is for a giant beast; the test should harder for legendary beast forms, say, from +4 for a werewolf to +8 for a ghost to +12 for a dragon (GM’s call). 

Object Transmutation 

**Morph Object (d4; 2 SP):** Change size or weight by one category (see Table—General Categories of Size and Weight) or alter an item’s color or shape. Altering clothing or accouterments in this manner adds +1d4 to Disguise checks. 

**Shapeshift Object (d8; 4 SP):** Change an item from one thing into another, although material remains the same. Size and weight can be shifted by one category (e.g., change a wooden desk into a chair). 

**Transform Object/Area (d4 to d12+2; 6 SP):** Change hardness, mass, or state (liquid, solid, or gas) or an object’s composition. Transmute lead into gold. The effect is temporary and must be maintained (see alchemist or magic item creation rules for more information). 

_Object Change Adjustments_ 

–1 to test to affect multiple objects (1 per die rolled). 

–2 to test per extra size or weight category change (per object). 

Note: A set of clothing or armor, or a pile of coins or pebbles, counts as one object for these effects. 

**General Categories of Size and Weights:** These table categories are rough guidelines; the example objects are ‘open’ in form. The structural hit point range indicates general item robustness but bringing an object to zero hit points is rarely necessary to make it dysfunctional. Breaking something is not as difficult as reducing it to rubble or powder. 

Alter Ability; Bonus or Penalty 

This magical effect alters a target’s ability by either enhancing or hindering its die rolls. Those affected by the Modify Ability penalty do not receive a saving throw. A bonus can be granted to oneself or another creature within range. 

Typically, this effect targets a single ability for augmentation. However, targeting multiple abilities or creating an area of effect is possible, which increases the spell’s difficulty and maintenance penalty. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting single, targeted ability. No higher than ±5. 

The challenge die always increases by one step for each static bonus or penalty affecting a specific, targeted ability (to a maximum of ±5 bonus or penalty). Add 1 step to the challenge die for each additional ability influenced by the spell. Furthermore, increase the challenge die by 2 steps if the spell is transformed into an area effect (e.g., a fog cloud affecting all Competence → Perception rolls). 

**Alter Ability Limitations:** Self-inflicted ability reductions (die rank or straight penalty) are not possible, even under mind control or when accidentally activated by reading a spell scroll (which differs from a cursed item). Hit points (defense points) cannot be directly increased or drained . Similarly, temporary penalties affecting a character’s targeted ability, such as a –2 to Strength, do not impact the passive defense pool. Apply –4 to the ability test for a selective area effect (all of one group — allies, foes, or creatures — are affected). 

Sense Roll Alteration 

This effect allows the practitioner of magic to alter his or her own or another target’s senses, such as sight and hearing, either enhancing or disabling them to various degrees. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting single, targeted sense. No higher than ±5. 

Debilitate Sense, in Afflictions above, is more severe but allows a saving throw. Apply –2 to the test if affecting a sense other than sight or hearing (i.e., taste/smell or sensation). 

Die Rank Augmentation 

The spellcaster can increase the die rank of any tier of a target’s ability branch. This can help with challenge rolls and physical saving throws, but never increases the target’s normal defense points. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per die rank increase to a maximum of d12. 

A bonus +1 die rank increases the die rolled from a d4 to d6, a d8 to d10, etc. These die rank increases can be applied to the basic or the specialties tier. Examples: d4 to d6 is challenge d4; d8 to d12 is challenge d6; d4 to d12 is challenge d10. This power cannot increase any trait or skill that has no existing rank. 

Die Rank Reduction 

The spellcaster can decrease the die rank of any tier of a target’s Prowess or Fortitude ability branches. This can hinder challenge rolls, physical saving throws, battle phase order (or random Agility rolls), but never decreases the target’s normal defense points (unless used in conjunction with a Harm effect). 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per die rank decrease, down to d4. 

If the target already has a d4 in the targeted trait or skill, then the challenge die is d4+2: this imposes a –2 on all the targeted ability’s rolls if successful. Examples: d6 to d4 is challenge d4; d12 to d8 is challenge d8, and d12 to d4 is challenge d12; d4 to d4–2 is challenge d4+2. 

Absorb

The Absorb subeffect allows the caster to convert potential harm into a temporary increase in the caster’s active defense points or spirit points. The maximum threat points that can be absorbed with each attack against the target is determined by the spell’s challenge die rank, ranging from 1 to 5 points, with any remaining threat points affecting the caster as usual. The spell’s total absorption limit is determined by the spell’s challenge die MV to a maximum of 12 points (at d12), with the temporary points pool remaining as long as the spell is maintained.

The Absorb subeffect can only convert harm that has not already been blocked or absorbed by other effects, and adding it to a spell will add a step to the total spell challenge rating.

Weapon Enhancement 

A single-effect Modify spell that features an increase to a mundane weapon’s potential harm always requires a test to avoid damaging the weapon. 

The caster increases or reduces a weapon’s harm or initiative bonus as follows: 

**Ability test =** 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting the single, targeted object. No higher than ±5. 

Object Durability 

The magic-wielder increases or reduces an object’s hardness (thereby increasing or diminishing structural hit points). 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per 20% of item’s hit points increased or diminished (e.g., Ability Test = d8 at 60%) 

Diminishing an object’s hit points by 100% allows an item a saving throw (bronze 3d12, iron 2d12, stone 2d10, brick 2d8, wood 2d6), else the object shatters or crumbles. 

The caster’s Competence branch MV × 2 determines base cubic feet affected for sizeable wooden objects: base structural HP are 1 per cubic foot of wood, 2 for stone, and 3 for metal. Doors are medium to large (10 cubic feet for a sturdy single door to 50 cubic feet for large double doors), and walls are huge. 

Object Repair 

This is a rather subjective category of magical alteration. The GM decides if it is difficult to repair some object circumstantially, deciding whether it is a task that is easy (d4), difficult (d6), demanding (d10), or formidable (d12).

Area-Effect Modification 

(Casting modifier only.) The spell’s effect can be transformed into an area effect, extemporizing the targeting from creature to area. The radius equals the linked spell’s ability branch MV in feet. Failure means only the normal potential effect applies.

**Protect**

Magic that provides damage reduction (DR) or cover to an individual or multiple targets is divided into shield, armor, protection wall effects, and immunity. 

_Protection Examples_

**Sorcery:** Toughen skin, change physical resistance, make immune to physical attack. 

**Thaumaturgy:** Summon armor or shields or translocate attuned magic items capable of generating force fields and other shielding powers. 

**Elementalism:** Create barrier walls of stone, wood, bronze, iron, force; walls of fire, water, wind. Assume pure elemental form, gaining varied levels of physical attack immunity. 

**Hieraticism:** Call upon gods or spirits to shield from harm, either damage reduction or various immunities granted for one or many. 

**Mysticism:** Generate kinetic shields.

**GM Note:** GM Note: Players may creatively activate spirit points to mirror some of the protection effect examples given above. However, magic-using classes may use spirit points to interrupt attacks in any battle phase, their effect is always instant, and their manifestation dissipates immediately.

Armoring Effects

Practitioners of magic provide themselves or recipients with magical protection, whether conjuring a suit of armor out of thin air or generating a force field that envelops and moves with the body. The manifestation depends on the source of magic: magical armor, force fields, conjured armor, hardening of the skin, etc. 

All armoring effect spells grant random damage reduction, rolled just as regular armor. The magical armor die value is used only when the beneficiary’s active defense points are exceeded. The challenge die to cast the spell equals the level of magical armoring effect, regardless of how it manifests. If the recipient is already wearing armor, whether normal or magical, do not roll both damage reduction types; instead, roll the higher of the two. If the magic armoring effect is of a lower die rank than armor already worn, add +1 bonus DR per die rank to the regular armor to simulate the spell’s augmentation.

Shielding Effects

A shielding spell reduces potential harm even before the defender uses active defense. It might be a conjured magic shield appearing in the recipient’s free hand or a semipermeable energy field generated around the body. Unlike regular shields or parrying weapons, such magic damage reduction works even when the protected recipient’s defense points are exhausted.

**Challenge:** d4 = -1 threat reduction, up to d12 = -5 threat reduction.

Shielding spells affecting an area do not work like walls but move with the group protected. For example, a spellcaster may create a shimmering and strangely viscous membrane centered on moving with him and his companions. If the recipient is already holding a shield, whether normal or magical, do not apply the static damage reduction twice; instead, add all bonuses together, divide by 2, and always round up.

Walls of Protection

Barrier walls provide total cover for those standing behind them. Their area equals the ability branch maximum in feet for length and height, but they can be reshaped at casting. The base wall type is packed earth or matted vegetation, with structural hit points equal to the caster’s ability branch maximum. The difficulty of an individually learned spell determines maximum thickness. Spells can be created to increase the wall substance and its structural hit points (equal to the caster’s relevant Expertise branch MV).

Penetrable Elemental Walls

Walls made of fire, wind, or water usually provide total cover directly in front of the caster. Mages are most learned in Elementalism (pertaining to fire, air, water, earth, and energy), though priests can invoke similar effects. Rather than ranged attacks whittling down their structural hit points, as with most total cover, such walls impose a –4 threat point reduction to ranged attacks. This is due to the opaqueness of fire or partial opacity and rushing movement of wind or water elemental walls; it is difficult to target those hiding beyond. Unless made to surround the caster, the typical elemental wall spell provides good (¾) cover further out to the sides but no cover behind. Passing bodily through such a wall also has consequences.

Elemental Immunity

Spells can grant elemental immunity against natural, non-magical elements like fire, electricity, wind, or environmental hazards. These are commonly used by mages exploring elemental planes. No spell confers total immunity to magical harm. Mythical creatures, particularly primordial beings, may possess immunity to specific elements. Elementals and transformed mages are immune to their respective elements. Incorporeal undead are immune to energy attacks, while corporeal undead are affected.

Physical Attack Immunity

Physical attack immunity provides short-term protection from normal weapons, unarmed attacks, and natural attacks of beasts. Immunity difficulty ratings are d8 for one of those attack forms, d10 for two and d12 for three. Any extension (e.g. to hazards) will incur high maintenance costs and often cost spirit points as well.

**GM Note:** Elemental transformation spells may grant immunity but limit offensive options. For example, air or spirit form mages face difficulties in physical attacks and spellcasting. Some elemental forms, like fire or energy, allow attacks using the caster’s basic Competence → Expertise dice. .

Disease and Poison Immunity

Mages, adepts, mystics, and theurgists can use rituals or spells for disease or poison immunity. Adepts may create magic items or potions granting immunity, either maintainable (costing spirit points) or permanent until dispelled.

**Restore or Destroy**

This section outlines the effects of divine magic spells for the purpose of aiding in their creation and understanding. See Chapter 2 for more information on Theurgist Feats. 

Divine healing in the Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition rules encompasses spells meant to heal and protect. Theurgists, who gain power from gods, and druids, who channel divine energies from nature, can cast these spells. They can heal injuries, cure diseases, counter poison effects, restore lost ability die ranks, regenerate limbs, and replenish spirit points. Challenge rolls determine the success of some spells. Divine healing spells are particularly useful during extended battles since the active defense pool requires rest to replenish. Restored hit points cannot exceed the target’s maximum score.

_Here are the key divine healing spells and their mechanical aspects_:

**Bolster:** A burst of divine or natural energy fills the target, invigorating body and mind, and helping it to withstand further attacks. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality. Challenge: d4 for active hit points or d6 for passive hit points. Replenishes active or passive hit points by the amount rolled.

**Mend:** The priest or druid channels healing power into the target's wounds, stitching flesh together and knitting bones back into place. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12. Restores both active and passive defense points by the roll of the tested ability branch.

**Cure Debility:** The priest or druid channels restorative power into the target, strengthening weakened limbs and renewing vitality. For more severe afflictions, this may require a ritual purification or exorcism. The spell restores temporarily lost ability die ranks at a spirit point cost equal to the die rank MVs. In rare cases of permanent reductions (such as those from powerful curses, epic-level traps, or voluntary character disadvantages), the cost is in Character Points equal to the die rank MVs. These instances require divine intervention and are treated as major narrative events. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality. Challenge: Special.

**Heal:** The priest or druid invokes the divine or natural forces of life, calling upon them to mend even the most grievous of injuries and renew the target's spirit. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12. Restores active and passive defense points by the roll of the tested ability branch.

**Negate Affliction:** The priest or druid purges the target's body of harmful toxins or infections, using either natural remedies or divine intervention to drive out the disease or poison. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resistance. Challenge: strength of poison, disease, or condition. Removes affliction or poison effect.

**Regenerate:** The priest or druid channels powerful restorative energies into the target, causing limbs and organs to regrow and wounds to knit together with supernatural speed. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience, Challenge: d12. Instantly regenerates defense points equal to the ability test roll. Limb and organ regrowth occurs over time: 1 round for a finger or toe, 5 rounds for a hand or foot, 10 rounds for an arm, leg, or internal organ (including skin).

**Rejuvenate:** The priest or druid pours vitality and energy into the target’s body, causing wounds to close and fatigue to dissipate, leaving it feeling rejuvenated and ready to fight on. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience. Challenge: d8 active or d10 passive. Replenishes hit points by MV of the tested ability branch, with failure incurring a spirit point cost equal to half the amount healed, rounded up.

**Spiritual Revitalization:** The priest or druid restores the target’s spiritual energy, whether through prayer, meditation, or some other means, reinvigorating body and mind with renewed zeal and vigor. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality, Challenge: d6 random or d8 fixed MV restoration points. Restores spirit points.

**Spiritual Smite:** The priest or druid calls upon divine or natural powers to imbue his or her weapon or fist with explosive energy, then striking a foe with a mighty blow that sends it reeling. Test: Prowess → Melee or Precision + Theurgy. Challenge: d8 (+3 threat) to d12 (+5 threat).

**Supernatural Intervention:** The priest or druid makes a desperate plea to the gods or the forces of nature, calling upon them to intervene in the battle at hand. The result can be anything from a subtle nudge in the priest’s or druid’s favor to a catastrophic upheaval of the battlefield, depending on the deity’s whims. Test: Competence → Expertise → Theurgy, Challenge: 2d12. 

Dark Invokers (Destroy Effect).

Theurgists who embrace hatred, corruption, and cruelty to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak are known as dark invokers. They are feared alongside master summoners of demonic powers, evil sorcerers, and aberrant thaumaturges who pose a threat to heroes in the Eldritch Realms. 

Among them, the necromancers are considered the most terrifying. Their magical abilities are powerful, wild, and dangerous, manipulating body and soul magic, using the corpses of former foes to do their bidding, or consulting the spirits of the dead to magically reveal the future or influence the course of events. The most infamous necromancers have raised undead armies or lived unnaturally for hundreds of years. 

For the particularly nefarious Game Master, the powers of dark invokers are detailed below, with representative spells covering more than just restoration magic’s inversion.

Execration 

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Ferocity 

**Challenge:** Special. The caster chooses one of the afflictions from the Effects of Magic; Slow d4 / 

**Knock Prone d6 / Stun d8 / Debilitate Sense d10 / Paralyze d12 / Incapacitate d12+2 / Distract d4 /** Confuse d6 / Terrorize d8 / Control Mind d10+1 / Possess Spirit d12+2. 

**Description:** The caster invokes his or her source of evil power to cause an affliction against a foe. The challenge die is the strength of the affliction the caster is attempting to inflict on the victim. See The Effects of Magic for this highly variable power.

Enfeeble or Injure 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Theurgy

**Challenge:** d4 (active) or d6 (passive)

**Description:** Active or passive hit points are reduced by the amount rolled. Failure means the dark magic fails. 

Cause Debility

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Ferocity

**Challenge:** Special.

**Description:** This requires a successful divine intervention (often at a price), or by sacrificing 2 character points worth of ability, lowering some ability by 1 die rank to cause an equivalent disadvantage suffered by a victim. The victim gets a saving throw of Fortitude → Endurance → Resilience to negate the spell’s effect long-term but still suffers the effects for 1 round per level of the caster.

**Enervate** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Willpower

**Challenge:** d6 (random threat points) or d8 (fixed MV drainage of spirit points).

**Description:** This feat depletes the spirit points of the victim either by the amount rolled or by the MV of the ability branch.

Unhallow

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Willpower

**Challenge:** d6

**Description:** The caster tears open a sliver of space with this invocation, the rift functioning as an invisible conduit to the deepest recesses of some collective well of evil thoughts and impulses. 

Any intelligent creature (other than the caster and allies) entering into the area affected by the emanations of evil thoughts and dreams emitted from the unhallowed conduit must make a saving throw using Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience, or begin to feel compelled to harm or betray those closest to them. Creatures can make the saving throw every minute, but the barrage of dismaying feelings and incredible dissonance usually causes great confusion and fear. The effect depends on the victim’s highest-ranked ability, as follows:

**Competence:** The victim is compelled to lie, verbally abuse, or otherwise cause mayhem for friends, loved ones, and allies; anyone visible within the area of effect (radius of 2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizard or Theurgy bonus). 

**Prowess:** The victim is suddenly aggressive and seeks to physically harm friends, loved ones, and allies in the unhallowed area. Those wielding weapons will attack anyone close to them, but not any allies of the caster, whose auras will appear too powerful and overwhelming to consider. 

**Fortitude:** Victims will want to intimidate, overpower (physically or mentally), or by any means possible drain the mental or physical endurance of those around them. Mystics are especially dangerous in the unhallowed ground if failing their saving throws. Mystics are especially dangerous in the unhallowed ground if failing their saving throws.

Shadow of Influence

**Category:** d8—Occult—Harm, Afflict (Multi-Effect)

**Rarity:** Secret (held by necromancers)

**Challenge:** d8 (base); d12 (with Great Competence → Expertise → Wizardry rank)

**Description:** This spell creates a dark stream of shadow that stretches out in the form of visible psychic energy, inflicting harm and disorienting the target. Threat points of non-physical damage, which are dodgeable but not parried or blocked, represent the inflicted harm.

**Disorientation:** The target suffers a -3 penalty to all skill checks and attack rolls for rounds equal to the caster's Wizardry focus bonus. During the spell's maintenance, the caster's other ability tests incur a -3 penalty.

**Intensified Form:** Mind Maelstrom

**Requirement:** Great (20+) Competence → Expertise → Wizardry rank. Before casting, the necromancer must announce the intensified form as intended. To activate, the necromancer must succeed at a d12 challenge die roll, expend 5 Spirit Points, and use a mastery die. The cost includes 1 Spirit Point per target beyond the first. The shadow disperses like a swirling cloud of darkness, impacting all targets within the caster's Expertise MV, measured in feet. Each target suffers non-physical potential harm and must make a Fortitude → Willpower saving throw. On failure, the caster can implant a suggestion, alter a memory, or create an illusion lasting up to 10 minutes per target. During the maintenance of these effects, the caster's other ability tests incur a -4 penalty.

Challenge Levels

The “Challenge Levels” table helps determine the probability of a character succeeding in an ability test against various difficulties. To use it, first identify the relevant Basic Ability and Specialty for the action—for example, Competence and Perception. Then, determine your Ability Level by combining the die ranks of the Basic Ability and Specialty; the total number of dice rolled indicates your Ability Level (e.g., rolling 2d6 makes you “Respectable”). Next, find the Challenge Difficulty assigned by the Game Master based on difficulty levels: Easy (d4), Moderate (d6), Difficult (d8), Demanding (d10), or Formidable (d12). Consult the table to locate the intersection of your Ability Level and the Challenge Difficulty to find your chance of success. If the challenge is tougher and attempted “With Disadvantage,” the GM rolls two challenge dice, reducing your chances as shown in the table’s second column. Note that Focus bonuses add to your roll after consulting the table but aren’t included in the probability calculations. Ties favor the player character.

Arbitrating Opposed Rolls

In the Eldritch RPG, ability tests are used for most actions to determine outcomes. It may be helpful to review the rules in Chapter 2, Action System, to provide additional context. 

Challenge rolls come in two main types: situational and contested. Situational challenges typically involve a physical ability or test of skill, while contested challenges involve active opposition from a living opponent. 

To make an ability test, players choose one ability branch and roll up to two dice to try to meet or exceed the GM’s challenge die roll or the challenge roll required for activation by a spell, magic item, or special power. 

It’s worth noting that saving throws are different from opposed rolls, in that they help against effects that bypass other defenses.

Saving Throws 

Saving throws are used specifically to resist severe effects, whether magical or otherwise, that would bypass other defenses, such as poison or afflictions like mind control or incapacitation. 

When making saving throws, characters can resist spells, innate abilities, and special combat feats where opponents roll against them. While such rolls are typically used when a character’s active defenses are bypassed, it may not always be clear when to use opposed rolls instead of saving throws. This is by design to give Game Masters more flexibility. 

When a character needs to make a saving throw, he or she uses the appropriate ability and add together the rolls for each die in the ability branch. Other creatures, on the other hand, are assigned a saving throw rank, which is a die or die combination that applies to every situation requiring an opposed roll.

Saving Throw Categories 

There are three categories of “saves” in the Eldritch RPG: Cognitive, Skillful, and Valorous. 

The standard saving throw ability branch is Ability → Specialty → Focus.

Cognitive Save

**Cognitive saving throws are used to resist effects that involve mental manipulation, deception, or other cunning tactics, such as resisting mind control or illusions.**

**Competence** → **Adroitness** → _Skulduggery_ or _Cleverness_: Characters can use their adroitness in skulduggery or cleverness to avoid or manipulate potentially harmful situations, such as avoiding traps or convincing an NPC not to attack them.

**Competence** → **Expertise** → _Wizardry_ or _Theurgy_: Characters can use their expertise in Wizardry or theurgy to protect themselves against magical harm, such as creating a magical barrier or dispelling an enchantment.

**Competence** → **Perception** → _Alertness_ or _Perspicacity_: Characters can use their alertness or perspicacity to notice and avoid dangers, such as spotting hidden traps or detecting an ambush.

Magic Defense Saves

Besides the spell powers provided by the Gift of Magic advantage, at Tier 2, magic-wielders gain access to the Magic Defense benefit (see page 23), which allows them to use their active defense pool to simulate protective energy in addition to other more common activities like parrying and blocking or dodging. This energy also helps shield them from nonphysical magical damage, such as psychic attacks. 

However, Magic Defense — using the active defense hit points — won’t protect against magical effects that require a saving throw, such as magical affliction effects. Rather, it allows a saving throw option for a caster trying to deflect or mitigate the effect of an affliction effect spell. Simply use the Competence → Expertise → Wizardry or Theurgy branch if that is more advantageous than the other option. 

Skillful Save

**Skillful saving throws are used to evade or handle threats through physical agility, melee combat, or ranged combat, such as dodging incoming projectiles or parrying an enemy's attack.**

**Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance or Vitality**: Used in vitality or resilience to resist physical harm, such as withstanding a powerful attack or resisting the effects of poison.

**Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might**: Used in ferocity or might to endure physical pain and push through adversity, such as resisting torture or breaking through an obstacle.

**Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience or Courage**: Used in courage or resilience to overcome mental harm, such as breaking free from mind control or resisting the effects of fear.

Valorous Save

**Valorous saving throws are specifically for resisting effects that require physical or mental fortitude, such as resisting poison, enduring physical harm, or breaking free from mind control.**

**Fortitude → Endurance → Resistance or Vitality**: Used in vitality or resilience to resist physical harm, such as withstanding a powerful attack or resisting the effects of poison.

**Fortitude → Strength → Ferocity or Might**: Used in ferocity or might to endure physical pain and push through adversity, even in dire circumstances, such as resisting torture or breaking through an obstacle.

**Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience or Courage**: Used in courage or resilience to overcome mental harm, such as breaking free from mind control or resisting the effects of fear.

“Twisted” Ability Saves

In addition to the standard ability branch, the Eldritch role-playing game permits twisted ability branches. Twisted branches combine abilities with specialties and foci from other branches (See Chapter 2, Action System, Twisting Branches). When crossing over from other branches, twisted branches are represented by a plus sign instead of a right facing arrow.

For example:

Cognitive:Competence + Willpower + Courage.

Skillful: Prowess + Strength + Ferocity.

Valorous: Fortitude + Courage + Resilience.

Agency Saving Throws

When an ability or spell incorporates Defense Negation—completely bypassing a character’s Active Defense points and preventing any parrying, dodging, or other active defense actions—an Agency Save may be attempted. This save is crucial when typical cognitive, skilled, or valor saves are unsuitable. The Agency Save is calculated using one of the following formulas, depending on the threat's nature:

• Competence + Mastery + Level

• Prowess + Mastery + Level

• Fortitude + Mastery + Level

If no mastery slot is available, the calculation defaults to the base ability score plus one point per level. The attacker's challenge die-rank determines the difficulty of the save. A successful Agency Save allows the character to use their Active Defense points, nullifying the negation effect. However, threat points still account for the attack's base potential harm, requiring other defenses to mitigate damage.

Agency Saves also apply in cases where standard saves are inadequate, such as complete immobilization from magical bindings or paralysis, and instantaneous debilitating effects from certain magical traps. Optionally, using an Agency Save may require spending two Spirit Points

Mastery in Eldritch RPG

The Mastery Die in Eldritch RPG acts as a versatile tool for enhancing a character's abilities. It can be added to any ability test, improving chances of success in various actions like climbing, persuasion, or deciphering ancient texts. In combat, it can be used to boost attack rolls, increasing the potential harm inflicted on enemies. It can also enhance the effects of Iconic Items, making these unique possessions even more powerful. For magic-wielders, the Mastery Die can be instrumental in ensuring the successful execution of spells.

Characters have a limited number of daily uses for the Mastery Die, determined by their level. While the daily usage is capped, they can use it multiple times within a single encounter or challenge. The 'Master Twist' mechanic, triggered when rolling the Mastery Die's minimum value with an iconic item, allows for a re-roll, turning potential failure into success. In the context of Path Magic, the Mastery Die also offers a re-roll when a 1 is rolled, reducing the risk of spell failure. Lastly, even when daily uses are exhausted, the Surge action allows for an extra Mastery Die roll at the cost of spirit points.

 Chapter 9: Arbitration

The game is organized like a reference manual, but fear not, it does not require an eidetic memory; nobody is expected to achieve mastery of rules minutiae. Nor does it assume the use of miniatures and tactical battle mats. Instead, it provides straightforward rules (and a few elaborations) based on simple principles, covering most normal actions and outcomes in the game, letting the GM use common sense in unusual situations. The first rule, though, is to see to the entertainment of all players. The rules are designed to provide a flexible framework that improves gameplay by helping players vividly describe character actions, bringing their ideas to life. 

Once you understand the game's mechanics, they serve the story, eventually fading into the background. The game balances creative player descriptions and the consistency provided by the mechanical rules. It is also easy to tailor the Eldritch RPG rules to suit your group’s unique play style. The more complex game rules can be introduced as and when the group is ready for them. The other design principle is “nothing is impossible,” which is why resolution favors randomization, and we are careful to avoid impossible target numbers and invincible damage resistances.

However, adventurers do have plenty of growth potential. Nothing is impossible given the right tools, skills, and aptitudes.

Hero development through an unfolding story is important and part of the fun of play. If at a disadvantage by lacking a certain spell or combat maneuver or magic item, the heroes can seek higher knowledge, develop greater puissance, and quest for mightier artifacts. 

Game Balance

In a tabletop role-playing game, how is game balance determined? At its most basic level, game balance refers to rules that promote fair and enjoyable play sessions for all parties engaged, with the Game Master as the arbiter. 

Game balance relates to all players' contributing meaningfully to the success of an adventure session, whether in combat, exploration, or interactions with creatures encountered. The Plyphyny rules underpin the Eldritch 2nd Edition game and are created with the author’s preferences in mind. 

Even so, mathematical equilibrium in all parts of the play is not the Holy Grail. Without considering the many possible milieux, the baseline for character power and effectiveness is arbitrary. The character concepts in this game are tropes, presented more narratively than mathematically. 

As such, any standard class and race combination costs between 70–96 character points, and are not all equal in character point cost, as any curious gamer with a calculator will discover. But players may want to create their own variation, and so guidelines for this are given below.

Custom Characters

The abilities of the Eldritch RPG in this 2nd Edition revolve around Fortitude, Competence, and Prowess. In essence, if broken down into the three archetypes of Rogue, warrior, and wizard, the feats and powers include everything the other classes do (i.e., assassins are a sub-type of rogue). A player can achieve that with just those three classes as a starting point. Each race and class ties well with a specific stat; Warrior to Fortitude, Rogue to Prowess, and wizard to Competence.

Eldritch has allowed players to create anything they want but with some guidelines. If custom characters are allowed in the game, or creatures featuring the Mythic Physiology advantage, like the Drakkin, then treat all characters as essentially custom, and grant even the regular combinations of race and class an extra 10 character points to spend (so a human or elf would get 20 CPs not just 10). 

With a warrior, the player knows the focus is on combat; with a mage, it’s magic, and with rogue, it’s utility or support. The specifics of their rogue, warrior, or wizard are then up to the player. Just like the assassin feats can go into the rogue archetype, all magic-related feats go into the wizard archetype, and so on. Wizards have access to all spell-like powers. Warriors get access to all combat-like feats, and rogues get access to all the utility feats. This is how customized characters are created.

Players can choose one of the three archetypes and choose feats and advantages or innate race/species flaws from those listed below. They may choose 4 feats from one archetypal list or two from each of two different archetype lists for unusual combinations.

• Warrior, Rogue, or wizard + 10 CPs for a custom class.

• Existing race + 10 CPs for a custom race.

• Mythic race (Drakkin or others in Ainerêve setting book incorporating the Mythic physiology advantage) + 10 Cps (plus 10 CPs to player characters of normal races).

• 80 CPs for complete customization.

Players who want to play a more tribal/barbarian-like character, for example, can choose the warrior class and focus on the brawn/rage/survival stuff. Alternatively, they may decide to play a knight-like character instead and focus on weaponry, armor, and shield feats and skills.

Alternative Focuses of Expertise 

The focus areas as described are the tip of the iceberg for customization. The areas provided represent the most commonly used areas of knowledge or skill in the game, but players may collaborate with GMs to further customize their characters further, adding new focuses at the regular cost granting bonuses to specific situations. 

Focus areas are either non-combat or combat-oriented and will add a bonus to either an ability check, potential harm, or initiative. Most often it is Competence → Expertise that’s easiest to expand, with endless possibilities in areas of knowledge: Diplomacy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Military Tactics, Religion, History/Lore, and so on.

Pick four feats from one list or two feats from two separate lists.

Focus Swaps 

When creating a character, players have the option to swap their racial focus bonus for a focus bonus related to one of the base minimum specialties of their chosen class. 

This allows characters to further customize their abilities and better align their focus bonus with their chosen class. If the chosen class has more than one base minimum specialty, the player can choose to swap the racial focus bonus for a focus bonus related to any of these specialties. 

If the chosen class has only one base minimum specialty, the player has two options: he or she can choose a focus that is not already granted by the class, or take a 4-point discount on another focus, spend an additional 4 points, and raise it to +2.

Archetype feats and advantages

Choose 4 feats from one archetypal list or two from two different lists.

Warrior 

Fortitude • Battle Savvy • Berserk • Brawl • Feat of Strength • Grapple • Maneuvers • Stunning Reversal • Sunder Foe

Wizard 

Competence • Arcane Finesse • Divine Healing • Dweomers • Intangible Threat • Iron Mind • Lore • Ritual Magic • Path Mastery: Priest, Druid, Thaumaturge, Sorcerer, Elementalist • Premonition • Psychic Powers • Spiritual Smite • Supernatural Intervention

Rogue 

Prowess • Backstab • Death Strike • Evasion • Lethal Exploit • Ranged Ambush • Roguish Charm • Shadow Walk • Stealth

Collaborating with the GM

Eldritch RPG's character creation system is designed to be flexible, allowing players to combine various abilities, specialties, and focuses to create unique and powerful characters. Players who wish to work with their Game Master (GM) to create new content, such as races, species, classes, or a combination of these elements, will find detailed guidelines in this chapter to ensure that new content integrates seamlessly with the game's existing mechanics.

To further customize their characters, players can select new focus areas that provide bonuses in specific situations. Players can collaborate with their GM to create additional focus areas, as long as they adhere to the game's structured cost and bonus rules. 

Example Classes:

**Archer:** Uses Prowess to enhance Precision, focusing on Ranged Threat and Ranged Finesse to attack from a distance. Archers can select feats from the Warrior list or collaborate with the GM to develop custom feats.

**Bard:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Wizardry, and Adroitness with a customized focus on Musicianship to cast spells and perform music, aiming to support and control crowds.

**Beastmaster:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Animal Handling and Perception with a custom focus on Nature Awareness, forming bonds with animals to command them in battle and navigate the wilderness.

**Chronomancer:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Willpower and Wizardry with a custom focus on Temporal Manipulation, and Competence to enhance Expertise with an Arcanum advantage to manipulate the flow of time, slowing enemies or accelerating allies.

**Paladin:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Endurance and Willpower, and Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Theurgy, smiting foes and healing allies, specializing in holy magic and righteous combat.

**Runesmith:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Artifice and Perspicacity with a custom focus on Rune Lore to create and use powerful runic artifacts, blending magic and craftsmanship.

**Sentinel:** Uses Fortitude to enhance Strength, and Competence to enhance Perception with a focus on Alertness to detect and respond to danger, specializing in defense and protecting allies.

**Shadowmancer:** Uses Prowess to enhance Agility with a custom focus on Shadow Manipulation and Competence to enhance Expertise with an Arcanum advantage to control shadows and darkness, using them for stealth, deception, and attacks.

**Spirit Whisperer:** Uses Willpower to enhance Concentration with a custom focus on Spirit Communication and Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Theurgy to communicate with and command spirits, leveraging their knowledge and power.

**Stormcaller:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a focus on Elementalism and Adroitness with a custom focus on Weather Manipulation to command the forces of nature, summoning storms and wielding elemental powers.

**Swashbuckler:** Uses Prowess to enhance Agility with a focus on Reaction and Speed, and Competence to enhance Adroitness for performing acrobatic feats and daring combat moves.

**Tactician:** Uses Competence to enhance Expertise with a custom focus on Strategizing, and Competence to enhance Perception and Perspicacity to devise battle strategies and anticipate enemy movements, specializing in tactical planning and coordination.

Example Races:

**Bestian (humanoid mammal):** Ability ranks begin with Competence at d6 and Prowess at d8, enhanced by Agility and Speed. Advantages include Animal Affinity, Mythic Physiology (claws or fangs), Empathic abilities, and Strong-Willed traits.

**Goblin:** Ability ranks start with Competence at d4 advancing to Adroitness at d6 with bonuses in Skulduggery and Cleverness, and Prowess at d6. Advantages include being Expeditious, possessing Mythic Vision adapted to darkness, a natural Sense of Direction in caves, and Survival skills.

**Kobold:** Starts with Competence at d4, advancing to Perception at d6, with bonuses in Alertness and Perspicacity, and Prowess at d6. Advantages include the ability to Read Emotions, innate Intuitive cunning, and robust Survival skills.The Effects of MagicDelve into the mystical realm of spellcasting as we explore the foundations of game spells and power effects, designed for advanced GMs and players eager to improvise or forge new spells. Magic effects comprise six categories: Activate, Afflict, Harm, Modify, Protect, and Restore (and its inverse Destroy), each hosting specific associated spells. 

**Activate** covers eclectic spells that escape categorization, including temporary powers, divine favor, non-combat spells, and enhanced luck. 

**Afflict** encompasses spells inducing negative status effects like confusion, mind control, and paralysis. 

**Harm** effects are magical attacks that deliver threat points, bypass defensive measures such as armor and active defense points, or amplify the potential harm. 

**Modify** effects enhance or curse abilities or equipment, ranging from weapon augmentation to enemy cursing. 

Protect effects consist of magical shielding, armor, protective walls, and immunities, proving invaluable for defensive and support characters. 

**Restore** spells remedy injuries, cure diseases, alleviate fatigue, rejuvenate the soul, and can even resurrect the dead, while **Destroy** effects unleash devastating consequences, such as obliteration or disintegration of objects or beings.

Wizards (mages or adepts) and theurgists (priests or druids) tap into distinct magical sources but may evoke similar spell manifestations. Wizards wield arcane energy to command preternatural forces, whereas theurgists direct divine or spiritual power via connections to deities or nature. Irrespective of power origin, mortals are incapable of countering spells cast by gods or avatars without legendary means or immense sacrifice, as divine beings possess power surpassing mortal boundaries. 

Magic’s potency hinges on the wielder’s skill and ingenuity rather than the source. The challenge rating of a spell or magic effect dictates the bonus, change, modification, or increase/decrease in die size steps: d4 (±1), d6 (±2), d8 (±3), d10 (±4), and d12 (±5).

Spell Potency, Challenge and Rarity

**Potency Level 1:** d4 / Common 

**Potency Level 2:** d6 / Uncommon 

**Potency Level 3:** d8 / Esoteric 

**Potency Level 4:** d10 / Occult 

**Potency Level 5:** d12 or above / Legendary 

**Activate**

An Activation is a miscellaneous effect that causes something to exist, or an event to happen, utilizing magic not otherwise covered. 

This includes the generation, dismissal, or manipulation of substances or energies (elemental spells), the summoning or translocation of creatures or objects (as with conjuring spells), or an effect set off by a contingent circumstance (which falls under various categories of ritual magic and magic Magic). 

Boon

A boon is any activation effect that grants a person or group some general advantage in dangerous or challenging situations. 

Such spells represent magic spells of utility, expeditiousness, or convenience to the heroes. For example, hastened travel through difficult terrain, the ability to breathe underwater, or the favor of the gods in battle (see spell listings for examples).

Summoning

This activation effect allows a magic practitioner to summon creatures from common beasts to demons and elementals, banish said creatures to another dimension, forcibly teleport a victim elsewhere, conjure or dismiss an object, or even open rifts for travel by “summoning” named places. 

A basic summoning spell calls some specific object or creature type per round, each incurring separate spell maintenance penalties. The range is the line of sight, up to Competence die MV × 2 in feet. The test can be modified by the size and magical nature of some creatures, as below. 

The summoner can banish a monster under his control without effort. However, if he loses control over a summoned creature, a battle of wills ensues (relevant magic-based ability branch versus the monster’s main attack: its highest threat dice). 

Summon Creature 

The creature materializes at the chosen destination point (which must be a safe place to manifest, or the creature gets an immediate special saving throw to break the spell: summoned dice value vs. the spell roll). After the first round, a summoned creature gets to roll its highest threat dice every round versus the caster’s Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or relevant magic-based ability branch, whichever the player prefers, to break free of the spell. If the conjured creature wins the contest, it vanishes or may attack the caster (GM’s discretion).

The basic ability test to summon a creature depends on its type, as below. The penalty is applied if the summoning fails. 

**Creature type /** examples / difficulty / penalty 

**• Minor:** cat, rat, bat / d4 / spell fizzles

**• Standard:** goblin, human / d6 / –1 spirit points

**• Exceptional:** manticore, gargoyle / d10+2 / –2 spirit points

**• Legendary:** giant, dragon / d12+2 / –3 spirit points

**Modifiers for Summoning Spells**:

Offsetting these modifiers may require spirit points’ expenditure, costing one spirit point per nullified penalty point. Note that some creatures are impossible to summon improvisationally without powerful assistive magic (as determined by the GM). 

Apply –1 to the ability test for each threat rank above 4 (applied to all threat dice equally), up to –5 penalty. Hit points are determined as per the rules in the Game Mastering section, Encounters. 

**Size Modifiers:**

**• Large:** -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points doubled.

**• Huge:** -2 penalty on the ability test, hit points tripled.

**• Gargantuan:** -3 penalty on the ability test, hit points quadrupled.

**Nature Modifiers:**

**• Magical:** -1 penalty on the ability test, hit points doubled.

**• Preternatural:** -2 penalty on the ability test, hit points tripled.

**• Supernatural:** -3 penalty on the ability test, hit points quadrupled.

If a creature’s challenge die is at its maximum, such as a 3d12 for a supernatural demon, the penalties from size and nature are consolidated and then divided by the number of threat dice to adjust the summoning challenge accordingly.

**Example**: Consider the summoning of a medium-sized, supernatural demon with 3d12 threat dice. The base challenge for this summoning is d10+2, increased by +3 due to the creature's supernatural nature, culminating in a d10+5 challenge for the summoning roll. Once summoned, the creature’s attempts to break free of the spell’s control commence from the second round onward. 

Each round, the demon rolls its highest threat dice against the caster’s chosen magic-based focus area, like Fortitude or Willpower, to escape control. To mitigate the risk of the demon breaking free, the caster can use spirit points to offset the demon's escape attempts. For each round, one spirit point can be spent to reduce the demon's threat dice by one level, thereby increasing the caster's chances of maintaining control. 

Swarm Summoning

A summoner can also choose to cast a swarm summoning, conjuring multiple very weak creatures, whether a horde of imps or a swarm of bees. The number of creatures summoned is equal to 2 × the MV of the challenge die chosen, and each creature has 1 threat point and 1 hit point. The creatures act as one group, with initiative equal to the caster’s Expertise rank. Swarms are always instinct-driven, and while able to follow simple commands, they never possess real intelligence or significant equipment. 

Swarm ability test = d4 through d12. 

A standard spell maintenance penalty kicks in on the second round, determined by the original test. The summoner can command a swarm or minion horde to attack in the same round they appear. The spell operates much like a regular area effect Harm spell, with the swarm attacking as many targets as it can surround, but unlike such a spell, the swarm damage is divided among those trapped by the summoned attackers. That means one defender caught takes the full brunt, but many take less potential harm since the attackers are split between defenders.• 

Banish Summoned Creature

Banishment requires exceeding the test roll needed to summon the targeted creature. Success means the summoning is broken, and the creature will vanish. 

Any failed attempt to banish a summoned creature also allows it an immediate saving throw to break free of the original summoner’s command. All practitioners of magic know when a summoned creature under their command is subject to an attempt to banish it.

Ritualized Creature Summoning

The ritual summoning of creatures increases spell duration and does not incur maintenance penalties but rather requires a focus object that must not be broken during the intended duration. 

The amount of time required to perform a ritual is equal to its desired duration. The summoned creature can attempt to break free after each multiple of that duration (the creature rolls its highest threat die rank versus the magic-wielder’s Fortitude → Willpower → Courage or Competence → Expertise → Wizardry ability branch, as the player prefers). 

Therefore, a ritual requiring two rounds to summon a goblin lets the goblin attempt to escape after every two rounds (so it could be free on the third). However, if it remains controlled for three months, the conjured creature becomes a permanent resident of the summoner’s settled land. After that, the creature may attempt to break free of the spell once a year or if forced into suicidal actions. If successful, the creature may attack or return to its home plane or wander at will.

Summon Object

Objects conjured for entertainment, like a colorful explosion of flowers, or small harmless items, are handled via common cantrips (automatic or d4). Sometimes the GM may allow an automatic success with a cantrip if not casting a spell under duress. 

Conjured objects are not illusory; each will have the expected mass and weight and possess structural hit points in that general range (GM decides). Such creation is not ex nihilo, but instead pulling an object from near or far (even if whereabouts are unknown). Summoned objects materialize where desired within an allowable range if the space is free of any creature or solid object. They remain so long as the spell is maintained. These objects will be as envisioned, e.g., lamps will be lit and filled with oil if so desired. The summoned objects can also be used as a means of attack, within limits, say, by dropping an anvil out of the sky (see Conjured Items as Hazards). 

The object is normally one of the following: one piece of regular armor, a weapon, a container, tool, wheeled vehicle, or mount, a plant, money (copper, silver, gold, platinum, mithral, gems), one ration, or clothes. Objects must be mundane and common to the experiences of the average adventurer. Ignorance of how an item works will not hinder the effectiveness of a conjuration spell. For example, if someone conjures a padlock it will work (so long as he conjures a key to accompany it). He does not need to be a locksmith to do this. 

Of course, this leads to interesting questions; how hard would the lock be to pick? What if he wants to create a silver dagger rather than one made of steel? How heavy is a conjured boulder? How much money can a magic-wielder create out of thin air? These sorts of questions are answerable with impromptu GM arbitration, but there are general standardized parameters. The challenge dice and modifiers for object summoning are as follows, on the Object Summoning Difficulty table:

_Object Summoning difficulty_

**• d4:** Minuscule (up to 5 oz), e.g., ring, mug; orTiny (up to 5 lb), e.g., coconut, breadbox. 


**• d6:** Small (up to 50 lb), e.g., saddle, chair. 

**• d8:** Medium (up to 300 lb), e.g., anvil, desk. 

**• d10:** Large (up to 2,500 lb), e.g., boulder, wagon. 

**• d12:** Huge (up to 25,000 lb), e.g., boulder, siege engine. 

**• d12+2:** Gargantuan (up to 50,000 lb), e.g., boulder, small ship. 

_Object summoning ability test modifiers_

• –1 per 50 coins worth of precious metals or gems.

• –2 for a set of related objects (e.g., clothing, armor, bag of coins).

• –2 per 10 feet above target (for dropping objects in attack).

• –4 for complex objects with moving parts or gears.

Conjured Items as Hazards 

When a conjured item is made to fall from the sky or to materialize in a motion that could impact someone, such usage is generally handled like a standard attack spell where damage is determined by the attack roll. For further refinement and additional details, the rules found in the Hazards section of Chapter 7 should be consulted. In instances where an object is falling, damage should be calculated based on both the size of the object and its height above the target. 

The following guidelines are suggested for damage based on every 10 feet of fall: Small objects: 4 threat points. Medium objects: 6 threat points.Large objects: 8 threat points. Huge objects: 10 threat points.Gargantuan objects: 12 threat points.These threat points should be applied up to a maximum fall distance of 100 feet, to acknowledge the impact limit imposed by terminal velocity. Beyond this height, no additional damage should be accrued. 

For defense against these hazards, characters can apply their Fortitude-based points to reduce damage before it impacts their hit points. This reflects their ability to potentially withstand or mitigate the impact to some degree.

**Indirect Attacks vs. Direct Hazards:** For indirect attacks like rolling boulders or toppling doors, which typically cause less damage than direct drops, they remain harder to avoid. Consequently, the threat points for these are the same as direct impacts, though no saving throw is allowed, which underscores their unpredictability and immediate danger.

Ritualized Object Summoning 

Items conjured by ritual do not incur maintenance penalties but rather become the spell’s focus objects and remain in existence for the spell’s duration. A tiny or bigger object requires one round to cast per challenge die increase (see above). 

The preparation time used in the ritual determines the frequency of the conjuration’s renewal requirement. If the magic-wielder spends two rounds to conjure a small wagon, they must perform the ritual every third round.

Teleportation

Teleportation per se is like summoning but usually involves magic recipients sending themselves, other creatures, or objects somewhere else. 

**Note**: Mortals cannot generally perform such a feat in Ainerêve, this sort of effect being the province of the gods or supernatural beings there. 

The place where creatures or objects are sent must be in sight, visited before, or studied extensively in books and accurately envisioned. Successful teleportation to a place inaccurately envisioned may result in going astray by 2d6 miles. Teleporting to the wrong place is immediately intuited if the magic-wielderhas visited the place before. 

There is also the option to teleport the unwilling to unsafe locations, near or far: this allows saving throws. 

Creatures teleported away against their will are permitted an opposed roll every round of the encounter to break the spell’s power. Success means the banishment is ended, and the one affected returns to the very spot occupied before he was whisked away by magic. Failure to save means the creature remains stuck, and the next save at a penalty of –2, and so on until there is no escape. If a saving throw becomes impossible, the spell no longer needs to be maintained, and the affected creature remains where it was sent.

**Teleportation difficulty** 

**• Challenge d8:** Teleportation of self or another willing creature, or small objects, only short distances (distance traveled is default range: up to 10 × basic tier MV in feet). 

**• Challenge d10:** Teleportation of creatures (including self) or up to medium-sized objects, up to base ability MV in number, up to miles equaling the branch MV. One test covers all affected.

**• Challenge d12:** Actual personal travel to other planes of existence for self and other willing creatures (including carried objects), up to base ability MV in number. Unwilling creatures get a saving throw each round (with an increasing penalty) and must be maintained until the affected cannot possibly win an opposed roll. 

_Teleport Attuned Items_ 

A magic practitioner can summon a unique existing item to their hands if they have owned it for at least one lunar cycle and have carved their sigil into it. The distance determines the test according to the teleportation (not summoning) rules. Attuned objects can include branded horses and wagons engraved with the sigil (see Attunement Sigil, under Wards & Runes in the Arcanum chapter), allowing for a traveling party’s mass teleportation. Attuned items stay once summonedTeleport Attuned Items 

A magic practitioner can summon a unique existing item to their hands if they have owned it for at least one lunar cycle and have carved their sigil into it. The distance determines the test according to the teleportation (not summoning) rules. 

Attuned objects can include branded horses and wagons engraved with the sigil (using ritual magic → Wards →Attunement Sigil), allowing for traveling parties' mass teleportation. Attuned items stay once summoned.

**Afflict**

Affliction effects are magical effects that can override a target’s free will or cause permanent changes to its mental, spiritual, or physical state, requiring an opposed roll against the caster’s ability test. They can be used in creature powers, NPC abilities, and traps. Defense scores cannot block Affliction effects, and only saving throws can resist them. These effects can stun, slow, distract, incapacitate, or magically control the mind or body. Any affliction caused by an _instant_ spell lasts for one round unless the specific spell description states otherwise.

Saving Throws

Saving throws against Affliction effects let characters use skills, luck, and abilities to avoid, counter, or reduce harmful conditions. 

_Cognitive_ saving throws protect a character’s judgment from mental manipulation and illusions. 

_Skillful_ saving throws help characters avoid or evade physical threats beyond active defense hit points. 

_Valorous_ saving throws resist poisons or let one break free from a villains’ magical commands.

Lingering or Permanent Conditions

Affliction effects can also cause persistent status conditions, such as pain and fatigue, that impede a character’s abilities even after the affliction’s primary cause has ended. To handle these effects, the following guidelines can be implemented: 

**Recovery:** Determine the natural healing rate for each ongoing effect, taking into account factors such as the character’s overall health and the severity of the affliction. 

**Remedies:** For each effect, identify appropriate treatments such as healing spells or medical procedures. Determine their effectiveness with ability tests. The rules allow for customization and the addition of new focuses. For example, a Competence → Expertise + Medicine focus might grant bonuses to ability tests related to administering medical treatment. 

**Long-term consequences:** Consider any permanent injuries or penalties that may result from ongoing effects. Players may collaborate with GMs to use existing flaws or introduce new flaws that reflect lingering or permanent conditions resulting from afflictions. These flaws grant extra Character Points that can be used elsewhere. 

Game Masters should aim for a balance between realism and playability when creating consequences for afflictions. This means avoiding excessive bookkeeping or overly punishing consequences while ensuring that the consequences make sense within the narrative. Ongoing effects from afflictions can provide immersive gameplay experiences that challenge players and serve as a reminder to avoid future afflictions.

Physical Afflictions

**Slow (Challenge d4):** Reduce the target’s initiative by one battle phase (effectively reducing the basic Prowess rank by one full step, for example, from d10 to d8). Increase the difficulty of the magic-wielder’s test by +1 when slowing the target two battle phases, +2 for three battle phases, and so on. A victim can be dropped down to below a d2 basic Prowess, with movement reduced accordingly.

**Knock Prone or Knock Back (Challenge d6):** The target must make a Skillful saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone or knocked back, depending on the spell or feat used. For spells, knockback distance is determined by the caster’s Willpower die rank in feet, reflecting their control over magical energy (e.g., 1d8 feet for a d8 Willpower). For feats, knockback may be based on the attacker’s Strength die rank. A successful save avoids the effect. Knockback may trigger opportunity attacks if the target ends within another creature’s reach.

**Stun (Challenge d8):** The target may not move or attack for one full round. It is considered temporarily incapacitated and may be more vulnerable to certain effects or attacks.

**Debilitate Sense (Challenge d10):** Cause total blindness or hearing loss, meaning most Competence → Perception checks using that sense automatically fail (GM's discretion; compensating for the loss may allow a roll with a –5 penalty). This effect can severely hinder the target's ability to interact with their surroundings or detect threats.

**Paralyze (Challenge d12+1):** The target is physically immobilized and loses access to any defense points but can still use innate aptitudes or cast spells with no somatic components (see Spells without Gesture or Word). It is unable to move or perform physical actions.

**Incapacitate (Challenge d12+2):** The target becomes unconscious, falls to the ground, and is vulnerable to attack. The saving throw required to resist this effect is based on Fortitude. Attacks on incapacitated targets bypass defense points and shields, directly reducing the target’s Fortitude. However, armor may still provide protection during general melee encounters. 

Mental Afflictions 

**Distract (Challenge d4):** This spell renders the target indecisive and uncoordinated, disrupting their ability to cast spells and perform complex actions effectively. The reduction in the target's initiative is calculated by dividing the caster's ability test roll by six, rounding up the result. This reduction directly impacts the target’s Prowess die rank or battle phase, thereby slowing their response time and affecting their order of action in combat scenarios.

**Confuse (Challenge d6):** The disoriented target struggles to focus on actions, disrupting concentration and hindering abilities. If engaged in close combat, he or she triggers an opportune attack unless using tactical withdrawal. Unable to attack until the same battle phase next round, he or she can move, support, or help in other ways. This subeffect is more severe than ‘Distract,’ potentially incapacitating or causing unpredictable actions.

**Terrorize (Challenge d8):** The target is stricken with fear, may not attack the magic wielder, and will run for its life until the next battle phase next round. If anyone (even the caster) stands in its way, though, it will attack him or her to try to get past. If those standing in the way of the fleeing creature are allies, an immediate Fortitude → Willpower save is allowed to prevent the creature from trying to violently force its way past. 

**Influence Mind (Challenge d10+1):** The caster can manipulate the target’s thoughts, emotions, or perceptions, causing it to experience altered beliefs, emotions, or sensory input. This subeffect allows for a variety of mental manipulations, such as implanting suggestions, altering memories, or creating illusions.

**Dominate Mind (Challenge d12+2):** Grants the caster total control over a target’s body and mind. Victims may be forced to attack friends or perform unwilling tasks. This effect represents extreme mental control. 

**Harm**

The Harm magic effect enables spellcasters to inflict physical harm on a target using various magical means, such as elemental spells, wizardry, theurgy, and psychic attacks. A basic magical attack with the Harm effect targets a single creature within the caster’s line of sight and maximum range. The mage rolls the relevant ability branch dice for threat points. To overcome a target’s passive defense, the spell’s Harm energy must penetrate active defense hit points. Armor may mitigate or block residual damage, while some spells can bypass armor or active defense (see page 75). 

Harm Spell Challenge 

A zero-challenge Harm spell is a standard attack roll and thus requires no test. Such a magical attack inflicts potential harm equal to the relevant ability branch dice. To increase the threat points of a Harm effect, casters must perform an ability test against a challenge die. If successful, the spell inflicts additional harm, but even if it fails, the basic potential harm still occurs. The table below shows the challenge die and corresponding threat point increase:

**Challenge die d4:** +1 threat point.

**Challenge die d6:** +2 threat points.

**Challenge die d8:** +3 threat points.

**Challenge die d0:** +4 threat points.

**Challenge die d12:** +5 threat points.

Magical Ranged Attack Forms

**Bolt:** Appears as a missile of some substance or a visible effect up to 1 foot in diameter that streaks towards the target (e.g., an ice spear or glowing ball). 

**Burst (area effect):** Burst attack spells usually appear as a bolt that expands or explodes on reaching the targeted point. The area affected is usually the radius of ability branch MV ×2 in feet, double that for mastered spells. A cubic volume will be up to 2 × basic tier MV in feet for height, width, and depth, double that for mastered spells. An area effect spell increases the test by one die rank. If a spell’s failure was associated with an area effect spell in a burst effect or area of effect (2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizardry or Theurgy Bonus MV, radius), then creatures within the radius take half threat point damage. 

**Stream:** A continuous line of effect up to 2 feet wide originating from the caster (e.g., an arc of flame). 

Non-Physical Potential Harm 

The distinction between parrying, blocking, or dodging is narrative, determined through Game Master and player collaboration during action sequences. As such, although a player would not describe use of active defense points as ‘parrying or blocking’ an intangible bolt of energy, the character could technically dodge, and in terms of game mechanics the active defense points are reduced in the same way. 

Intangible, Non-lethal Attacks 

However, some manifestations of spell energy negate various defenses. Unblockable by ordinary shields or swords, they require a minimum challenge die of d8. Some non-lethal, non-physical attacks subdue rather than kill, such as illusory threat points, which are mitigated by a successful saving throw before affecting passive defense. This mode can render targets unconscious but not take them below below zero passive defense. 

Invisible, Intangible Attacks 

Invisible and intangible psychic attacks, another form of non-physical harm, target the victim’s mind or spirit directly, bypassing physical defenses. These attacks may induce mental or emotional distress, manipulate thoughts, or even cause debilitating pain. 

Invisible spell energies can be challenging to detect or defend against, often requiring specialized magical defenses, heightened perception, or innate psychic resistance. Despite their intangible nature, some psychic attacks can still be evaded or resisted by a target’s mental fortitude or innate ability to counter psychic energy. 

Certain classes can use the Magic Defense advantage to defend against intangible magical 

attacks (see page 187 and page 87). 

Defense Negation

Defense negation is a powerful tool in a spellcaster’s arsenal, allowing the caster to bypass a target’s defenses at the cost of 1 spirit point for every die rank of the spell’s final challenge rating. If the caster does not have enough spirit points to pay for defense negation, he or she cannot use this ability.

**Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1-5 Spirit points):** The spell can negate the target's armor up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die for this effect is equal to the armor's die rank, making the spell's effectiveness contingent on the strength of the target’s armor.

**Bypass Shield (d8 to d12; 3–5 spirit points):** The spell negates the opponent’s physical or magical shield up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = d8/d10/d12 for a small/medium/large shield, with a spirit point cost of 3/4/5 respectively.

**Bypass Armor (d4 to d12; 1–5 spirit points):** The spell can negate the target’s armor up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = the armor die, with a spirit point cost of 1 per rank (1 at d4 up to 5 at d12).

**Bypass Active Defense (d12; 5 spirit points):** The spell negates the target’s active defense up to the maximum allowed by the spell. The challenge die = d12 with a spirit point cost of 5.

For all forms of defense negation Harm subeffects, a spell created with the subeffect alone can be maintained to keep the target vulnerable to subsequent attacks from others until the maximum duration, following the universal spell maintenance rules.

Collateral Hazards of Magic

Latent hazards are secondary consequences that occur when a spell interacts with particular materials or conditions. A spell’s latent hazard only activates if the target’s protection is vulnerable to the manifestation. However, objects and vulnerable materials may still be affected or damaged by area effect spells. As a rule of thumb, the GM may add +2 threat points for such interactions. However, the most potent activation of such a hazard can be triggered by a player character rolling the maximum value on the mastery die (when that option is invoked) or when using an iconic magical focus. Examples of collateral hazards include: 

**Magical Combustion:** Flammable objects in the area may ignite due to the spell, causing larger fires and damage to structures or additional targets. Single-target effects include ongoing damage from burning clothing or gear. 

**Enchantment Weakening:** Area effects may damage enchanted structures or objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects may weaken or break magical armor or gear. 

**Fragile Object Shatter / Mystical Air Disruption:** Area effects may shatter delicate objects and cause difficulty breathing or concentrating due to mystical air disturbances, while single-target effects may break fragile items and affect the target’s breathing or concentration. 

**Arcane Shock / Ground Tremor:** Area effects may cause muscle contractions or arcane energy surges, making the ground unstable. Single-target effects may knock the target prone or cause muscle contractions or arcane energy disruptions. 

**Armor Ignition / Magical Force:** Area effects may cause discomfort or additional damage to creatures wearing enchanted metal armor or hurl unsecured objects with magical force. Single-target effects may cause discomfort, additional damage, or knock the target prone. 

**Modify**

The Modify effect allows a spellcaster to modify the target creature’s attributes or abilities. This could be to modify attack potential, transform victims or allies into other creatures to either benefit or severely hinder, transmorph objects, augment senses or natural abilities, and so on.

Modify Vulnerability

The Modify Vulnerability subeffect allows spell crafters to create spells that bypass shields, active defenses, or armor, either as an inherent property of the spell formula or as optional casting modifiers for increased flexibility. It can be combined with a Harm effect to enhance the potency of an attack spell by bypassing defenses that may not have been vulnerable to non-physical or intangible energies. 

Up to six variations of vulnerability can be incorporated into a spell, individually or in combination, enabling even materials and armor types that are not normally vulnerable to specific types of damage to become susceptible.

**Armor Negation:** Challenge equal to armor die-rank. 

**Shield Negation:** Ability test penalty of –1 to –3; added only as a spell modifier option. 

**Active Defense Negation:** Minimum challenge of d8 to eliminate descriptive blocking or parrying possibilities, d10 to eliminate blocking, parrying, or evading, and d12 to eliminate dodging and leaping out of the way. 

Incur Material Vulnerability

This targets specific materials or armor weaknesses, making them more susceptible to a chosen magical manifestation. The Modify Vulnerability subeffect can trigger latent hazards if the caster’s Expertise rank is equal to or greater than the spell’s Challenge Rank. These hazards inflict potential harm equal to the spell’s Challenge Rank and can be triggered by rolling the maximum value on the caster’s mastery die or by using an iconic magical focus.

**Heating or Freezing:** Area effects can freeze or melt objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects can cause ongoing damage from freezing or melting. Additionally, area effects can ignite flammable objects, resulting in larger fires and damage to structures or other targets, whereas single-target effects can cause continuous harm due to burning clothing or equipment. 

**Weakening (or Embrittling):** Area effects may damage structures or objects made of affected materials, while single-target effects may weaken or break armor or gear. 

**Sundering (Shattering, Ripping, Tearing, Crumbling, or Fragmenting):** Potential harm equal to Challenge Rank. Area effects may break fragile objects and cause damage to structures, while single-target effects may break, tear, or shatter armor or gear.

Transmogrify 

Creature Shapeshift 

**Transmute Creature (d8; 3 SP):** The caster can alter hair and skin color and texture, height, weight, and gender within the caster or target species' norms. 

**Shapeshift (d10; 4 SP):** Can change size (in the range tiny, small, medium); alter type into goblinoid, animal, aquatic, or vermin. (Add +2 challenge per change in a size outside the given range.) 

The target gains any racial abilities; height, weight, and gender are under caster control but must fall within the new form’s norms. Equipment held or worn melds into form, reappearing when the effect ends. The caster can know one form per specialty die rank, unless the new form is improvised, costing a Spirit Point.

**Greater Shapeshift (d12; 5 SP):**A shapeshifting master can transform into any living being at will, from a mouse to a dragon, shifting once per round as long as the spell is maintained. The recipient of this power can transform into a giant or legendary beast, changing its size to large, huge, or even gargantuan. The target gains all of the form’s physical special attacks and defenses but does not gain modifiers to overall hit points based on the form’s size or nature. 

**Transform (d12+2; 6 SP):** The target gets all of the form's physical special attacks and defenses, and for a short time, they also get the size or nature-based HP or defense bonuses. This effect can also turn another creature in sight into something inanimate, like stone or another hard substance, making it helpless until the spell is broken. Allows a saving throw if the target is resisting. 

Note: If the caster wishes to grant the target size or nature-based HP or defense bonuses, they must add a +4 challenge modifier for each bonus type applied (e.g., +4 for size-based HP, +4 for nature-based defense). The base number is for a giant beast; the test should harder for legendary beast forms, say, from +4 for a werewolf to +8 for a ghost to +12 for a dragon (GM’s call). 

Object Transmutation 

**Morph Object (d4; 2 SP):** Change size or weight by one category (see Table—General Categories of Size and Weight) or alter an item’s color or shape. Altering clothing or accouterments in this manner adds +1d4 to Disguise checks. 

**Shapeshift Object (d8; 4 SP):** Change an item from one thing into another, although material remains the same. Size and weight can be shifted by one category (e.g., change a wooden desk into a chair). 

**Transform Object/Area (d4 to d12+2; 6 SP):** Change hardness, mass, or state (liquid, solid, or gas) or an object’s composition. Transmute lead into gold. The effect is temporary and must be maintained (see alchemist or magic item creation rules for more information). 

_Object Change Adjustments_ 

–1 to test to affect multiple objects (1 per die rolled). 

–2 to test per extra size or weight category change (per object). 

Note: A set of clothing or armor, or a pile of coins or pebbles, counts as one object for these effects. 

**General Categories of Size and Weights:** These table categories are rough guidelines; the example objects are ‘open’ in form. The structural hit point range indicates general item robustness but bringing an object to zero hit points is rarely necessary to make it dysfunctional. Breaking something is not as difficult as reducing it to rubble or powder. 

Alter Ability; Bonus or Penalty 

This magical effect alters a target’s ability by either enhancing or hindering its die rolls. Those affected by the Modify Ability penalty do not receive a saving throw. A bonus can be granted to oneself or another creature within range. 

Typically, this effect targets a single ability for augmentation. However, targeting multiple abilities or creating an area of effect is possible, which increases the spell’s difficulty and maintenance penalty. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting single, targeted ability. No higher than ±5. 

The challenge die always increases by one step for each static bonus or penalty affecting a specific, targeted ability (to a maximum of ±5 bonus or penalty). Add 1 step to the challenge die for each additional ability influenced by the spell. Furthermore, increase the challenge die by 2 steps if the spell is transformed into an area effect (e.g., a fog cloud affecting all Competence → Perception rolls). 

**Alter Ability Limitations:** Self-inflicted ability reductions (die rank or straight penalty) are not possible, even under mind control or when accidentally activated by reading a spell scroll (which differs from a cursed item). Hit points (defense points) cannot be directly increased or drained . Similarly, temporary penalties affecting a character’s targeted ability, such as a –2 to Strength, do not impact the passive defense pool. Apply –4 to the ability test for a selective area effect (all of one group — allies, foes, or creatures — are affected). 

Sense Roll Alteration 

This effect allows the practitioner of magic to alter his or her own or another target’s senses, such as sight and hearing, either enhancing or disabling them to various degrees. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting single, targeted sense. No higher than ±5. 

Debilitate Sense, in Afflictions above, is more severe but allows a saving throw. Apply –2 to the test if affecting a sense other than sight or hearing (i.e., taste/smell or sensation). 

Die Rank Augmentation 

The spellcaster can increase the die rank of any tier of a target’s ability branch. This can help with challenge rolls and physical saving throws, but never increases the target’s normal defense points. 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per die rank increase to a maximum of d12. 

A bonus +1 die rank increases the die rolled from a d4 to d6, a d8 to d10, etc. These die rank increases can be applied to the basic or the specialties tier. Examples: d4 to d6 is challenge d4; d8 to d12 is challenge d6; d4 to d12 is challenge d10. This power cannot increase any trait or skill that has no existing rank. 

Die Rank Reduction 

The spellcaster can decrease the die rank of any tier of a target’s Prowess or Fortitude ability branches. This can hinder challenge rolls, physical saving throws, battle phase order (or random Agility rolls), but never decreases the target’s normal defense points (unless used in conjunction with a Harm effect). 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per die rank decrease, down to d4. 

If the target already has a d4 in the targeted trait or skill, then the challenge die is d4+2: this imposes a –2 on all the targeted ability’s rolls if successful. Examples: d6 to d4 is challenge d4; d12 to d8 is challenge d8, and d12 to d4 is challenge d12; d4 to d4–2 is challenge d4+2. 

Absorb

The Absorb subeffect allows the caster to convert potential harm into a temporary increase in the caster’s active defense points or spirit points. The maximum threat points that can be absorbed with each attack against the target is determined by the spell’s challenge die rank, ranging from 1 to 5 points, with any remaining threat points affecting the caster as usual. The spell’s total absorption limit is determined by the spell’s challenge die MV to a maximum of 12 points (at d12), with the temporary points pool remaining as long as the spell is maintained.

The Absorb subeffect can only convert harm that has not already been blocked or absorbed by other effects, and adding it to a spell will add a step to the total spell challenge rating.

Weapon Enhancement 

A single-effect Modify spell that features an increase to a mundane weapon’s potential harm always requires a test to avoid damaging the weapon. 

The caster increases or reduces a weapon’s harm or initiative bonus as follows: 

**Ability test =** 1 challenge die rank increase per static bonus or penalty affecting the single, targeted object. No higher than ±5. 

Object Durability 

The magic-wielder increases or reduces an object’s hardness (thereby increasing or diminishing structural hit points). 

**Ability test** = 1 challenge die per 20% of item’s hit points increased or diminished (e.g., Ability Test = d8 at 60%) 

Diminishing an object’s hit points by 100% allows an item a saving throw (bronze 3d12, iron 2d12, stone 2d10, brick 2d8, wood 2d6), else the object shatters or crumbles. 

The caster’s Competence branch MV × 2 determines base cubic feet affected for sizeable wooden objects: base structural HP are 1 per cubic foot of wood, 2 for stone, and 3 for metal. Doors are medium to large (10 cubic feet for a sturdy single door to 50 cubic feet for large double doors), and walls are huge. 

Object Repair 

This is a rather subjective category of magical alteration. The GM decides if it is difficult to repair some object circumstantially, deciding whether it is a task that is easy (d4), difficult (d6), demanding (d10), or formidable (d12).

Area-Effect Modification 

(Casting modifier only.) The spell’s effect can be transformed into an area effect, extemporizing the targeting from creature to area. The radius equals the linked spell’s ability branch MV in feet. Failure means only the normal potential effect applies.

**Protect**

Magic that provides damage reduction (DR) or cover to an individual or multiple targets is divided into shield, armor, protection wall effects, and immunity. 

_Protection Examples_

**Sorcery:** Toughen skin, change physical resistance, make immune to physical attack. 

**Thaumaturgy:** Summon armor or shields or translocate attuned magic items capable of generating force fields and other shielding powers. 

**Elementalism:** Create barrier walls of stone, wood, bronze, iron, force; walls of fire, water, wind. Assume pure elemental form, gaining varied levels of physical attack immunity. 

**Hieraticism:** Call upon gods or spirits to shield from harm, either damage reduction or various immunities granted for one or many. 

**Mysticism:** Generate kinetic shields.

**GM Note:** GM Note: Players may creatively activate spirit points to mirror some of the protection effect examples given above. However, magic-using classes may use spirit points to interrupt attacks in any battle phase, their effect is always instant, and their manifestation dissipates immediately.

Armoring Effects

Practitioners of magic provide themselves or recipients with magical protection, whether conjuring a suit of armor out of thin air or generating a force field that envelops and moves with the body. The manifestation depends on the source of magic: magical armor, force fields, conjured armor, hardening of the skin, etc. 

All armoring effect spells grant random damage reduction, rolled just as regular armor. The magical armor die value is used only when the beneficiary’s active defense points are exceeded. The challenge die to cast the spell equals the level of magical armoring effect, regardless of how it manifests. If the recipient is already wearing armor, whether normal or magical, do not roll both damage reduction types; instead, roll the higher of the two. If the magic armoring effect is of a lower die rank than armor already worn, add +1 bonus DR per die rank to the regular armor to simulate the spell’s augmentation.

Shielding Effects

A shielding spell reduces potential harm even before the defender uses active defense. It might be a conjured magic shield appearing in the recipient’s free hand or a semipermeable energy field generated around the body. Unlike regular shields or parrying weapons, such magic damage reduction works even when the protected recipient’s defense points are exhausted.

**Challenge:** d4 = -1 threat reduction, up to d12 = -5 threat reduction.

Shielding spells affecting an area do not work like walls but move with the group protected. For example, a spellcaster may create a shimmering and strangely viscous membrane centered on moving with him and his companions. If the recipient is already holding a shield, whether normal or magical, do not apply the static damage reduction twice; instead, add all bonuses together, divide by 2, and always round up.

Walls of Protection

Barrier walls provide total cover for those standing behind them. Their area equals the ability branch maximum in feet for length and height, but they can be reshaped at casting. The base wall type is packed earth or matted vegetation, with structural hit points equal to the caster’s ability branch maximum. The difficulty of an individually learned spell determines maximum thickness. Spells can be created to increase the wall substance and its structural hit points (equal to the caster’s relevant Expertise branch MV).

Penetrable Elemental Walls

Walls made of fire, wind, or water usually provide total cover directly in front of the caster. Mages are most learned in Elementalism (pertaining to fire, air, water, earth, and energy), though priests can invoke similar effects. Rather than ranged attacks whittling down their structural hit points, as with most total cover, such walls impose a –4 threat point reduction to ranged attacks. This is due to the opaqueness of fire or partial opacity and rushing movement of wind or water elemental walls; it is difficult to target those hiding beyond. Unless made to surround the caster, the typical elemental wall spell provides good (¾) cover further out to the sides but no cover behind. Passing bodily through such a wall also has consequences.

Elemental Immunity

Spells can grant elemental immunity against natural, non-magical elements like fire, electricity, wind, or environmental hazards. These are commonly used by mages exploring elemental planes. No spell confers total immunity to magical harm. Mythical creatures, particularly primordial beings, may possess immunity to specific elements. Elementals and transformed mages are immune to their respective elements. Incorporeal undead are immune to energy attacks, while corporeal undead are affected.

Physical Attack Immunity

Physical attack immunity provides short-term protection from normal weapons, unarmed attacks, and natural attacks of beasts. Immunity difficulty ratings are d8 for one of those attack forms, d10 for two and d12 for three. Any extension (e.g. to hazards) will incur high maintenance costs and often cost spirit points as well.

**GM Note:** Elemental transformation spells may grant immunity but limit offensive options. For example, air or spirit form mages face difficulties in physical attacks and spellcasting. Some elemental forms, like fire or energy, allow attacks using the caster’s basic Competence → Expertise dice. .

Disease and Poison Immunity

Mages, adepts, mystics, and theurgists can use rituals or spells for disease or poison immunity. Adepts may create magic items or potions granting immunity, either maintainable (costing spirit points) or permanent until dispelled.

**Restore or Destroy**

This section outlines the effects of divine magic spells for the purpose of aiding in their creation and understanding. See Chapter 2 for more information on Theurgist Feats. 

Divine healing in the Eldritch RPG 2nd Edition rules encompasses spells meant to heal and protect. Theurgists, who gain power from gods, and druids, who channel divine energies from nature, can cast these spells. They can heal injuries, cure diseases, counter poison effects, restore lost ability die ranks, regenerate limbs, and replenish spirit points. Challenge rolls determine the success of some spells. Divine healing spells are particularly useful during extended battles since the active defense pool requires rest to replenish. Restored hit points cannot exceed the target’s maximum score.

_Here are the key divine healing spells and their mechanical aspects_:

**Bolster:** A burst of divine or natural energy fills the target, invigorating body and mind, and helping it to withstand further attacks. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality. Challenge: d4 for active hit points or d6 for passive hit points. Replenishes active or passive hit points by the amount rolled.

**Mend:** The priest or druid channels healing power into the target's wounds, stitching flesh together and knitting bones back into place. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12. Restores both active and passive defense points by the roll of the tested ability branch.

**Cure Debility:** The priest or druid channels restorative power into the target, strengthening weakened limbs and renewing vitality. For more severe afflictions, this may require a ritual purification or exorcism. The spell restores temporarily lost ability die ranks at a spirit point cost equal to the die rank MVs. In rare cases of permanent reductions (such as those from powerful curses, epic-level traps, or voluntary character disadvantages), the cost is in Character Points equal to the die rank MVs. These instances require divine intervention and are treated as major narrative events. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality. Challenge: Special.

**Heal:** The priest or druid invokes the divine or natural forces of life, calling upon them to mend even the most grievous of injuries and renew the target's spirit. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality/Resilience. Challenge: d12. Restores active and passive defense points by the roll of the tested ability branch.

**Negate Affliction:** The priest or druid purges the target's body of harmful toxins or infections, using either natural remedies or divine intervention to drive out the disease or poison. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resistance. Challenge: strength of poison, disease, or condition. Removes affliction or poison effect.

**Regenerate:** The priest or druid channels powerful restorative energies into the target, causing limbs and organs to regrow and wounds to knit together with supernatural speed. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience, Challenge: d12. Instantly regenerates defense points equal to the ability test roll. Limb and organ regrowth occurs over time: 1 round for a finger or toe, 5 rounds for a hand or foot, 10 rounds for an arm, leg, or internal organ (including skin).

**Rejuvenate:** The priest or druid pours vitality and energy into the target’s body, causing wounds to close and fatigue to dissipate, leaving it feeling rejuvenated and ready to fight on. Test: Competence → Expertise + Resilience. Challenge: d8 active or d10 passive. Replenishes hit points by MV of the tested ability branch, with failure incurring a spirit point cost equal to half the amount healed, rounded up.

**Spiritual Revitalization:** The priest or druid restores the target’s spiritual energy, whether through prayer, meditation, or some other means, reinvigorating body and mind with renewed zeal and vigor. Test: Competence → Expertise + Vitality, Challenge: d6 random or d8 fixed MV restoration points. Restores spirit points.

**Spiritual Smite:** The priest or druid calls upon divine or natural powers to imbue his or her weapon or fist with explosive energy, then striking a foe with a mighty blow that sends it reeling. Test: Prowess → Melee or Precision + Theurgy. Challenge: d8 (+3 threat) to d12 (+5 threat).

**Supernatural Intervention:** The priest or druid makes a desperate plea to the gods or the forces of nature, calling upon them to intervene in the battle at hand. The result can be anything from a subtle nudge in the priest’s or druid’s favor to a catastrophic upheaval of the battlefield, depending on the deity’s whims. Test: Competence → Expertise → Theurgy, Challenge: 2d12. 

Dark Invokers (Destroy Effect).

Theurgists who embrace hatred, corruption, and cruelty to bring ruin to the holy and tyranny to the weak are known as dark invokers. They are feared alongside master summoners of demonic powers, evil sorcerers, and aberrant thaumaturges who pose a threat to heroes in the Eldritch Realms. 

Among them, the necromancers are considered the most terrifying. Their magical abilities are powerful, wild, and dangerous, manipulating body and soul magic, using the corpses of former foes to do their bidding, or consulting the spirits of the dead to magically reveal the future or influence the course of events. The most infamous necromancers have raised undead armies or lived unnaturally for hundreds of years. 

For the particularly nefarious Game Master, the powers of dark invokers are detailed below, with representative spells covering more than just restoration magic’s inversion.

Execration 

**Test:** Fortitude → Willpower + Ferocity 

**Challenge:** Special. The caster chooses one of the afflictions from the Effects of Magic; Slow d4 / 

**Knock Prone d6 / Stun d8 / Debilitate Sense d10 / Paralyze d12 / Incapacitate d12+2 / Distract d4 /** Confuse d6 / Terrorize d8 / Control Mind d10+1 / Possess Spirit d12+2. 

**Description:** The caster invokes his or her source of evil power to cause an affliction against a foe. The challenge die is the strength of the affliction the caster is attempting to inflict on the victim. See The Effects of Magic for this highly variable power.

Enfeeble or Injure 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Theurgy

**Challenge:** d4 (active) or d6 (passive)

**Description:** Active or passive hit points are reduced by the amount rolled. Failure means the dark magic fails. 

Cause Debility

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Ferocity

**Challenge:** Special.

**Description:** This requires a successful divine intervention (often at a price), or by sacrificing 2 character points worth of ability, lowering some ability by 1 die rank to cause an equivalent disadvantage suffered by a victim. The victim gets a saving throw of Fortitude → Endurance → Resilience to negate the spell’s effect long-term but still suffers the effects for 1 round per level of the caster.

**Enervate** 

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Willpower

**Challenge:** d6 (random threat points) or d8 (fixed MV drainage of spirit points).

**Description:** This feat depletes the spirit points of the victim either by the amount rolled or by the MV of the ability branch.

Unhallow

**Test:** Competence → Expertise + Willpower

**Challenge:** d6

**Description:** The caster tears open a sliver of space with this invocation, the rift functioning as an invisible conduit to the deepest recesses of some collective well of evil thoughts and impulses. 

Any intelligent creature (other than the caster and allies) entering into the area affected by the emanations of evil thoughts and dreams emitted from the unhallowed conduit must make a saving throw using Fortitude → Willpower → Resilience, or begin to feel compelled to harm or betray those closest to them. Creatures can make the saving throw every minute, but the barrage of dismaying feelings and incredible dissonance usually causes great confusion and fear. The effect depends on the victim’s highest-ranked ability, as follows:

**Competence:** The victim is compelled to lie, verbally abuse, or otherwise cause mayhem for friends, loved ones, and allies; anyone visible within the area of effect (radius of 2x Competence → Expertise MV + Wizard or Theurgy bonus). 

**Prowess:** The victim is suddenly aggressive and seeks to physically harm friends, loved ones, and allies in the unhallowed area. Those wielding weapons will attack anyone close to them, but not any allies of the caster, whose auras will appear too powerful and overwhelming to consider. 

**Fortitude:** Victims will want to intimidate, overpower (physically or mentally), or by any means possible drain the mental or physical endurance of those around them. Mystics are especially dangerous in the unhallowed ground if failing their saving throws. Mystics are especially dangerous in the unhallowed ground if failing their saving throws.

Shadow of Influence

**Category:** d8—Occult—Harm, Afflict (Multi-Effect)

**Rarity:** Secret (held by necromancers)

**Challenge:** d8 (base); d12 (with Great Competence → Expertise → Wizardry rank)

**Description:** This spell creates a dark stream of shadow that stretches out in the form of visible psychic energy, inflicting harm and disorienting the target. Threat points of non-physical damage, which are dodgeable but not parried or blocked, represent the inflicted harm.

**Disorientation:** The target suffers a -3 penalty to all skill checks and attack rolls for rounds equal to the caster's Wizardry focus bonus. During the spell's maintenance, the caster's other ability tests incur a -3 penalty.

**Intensified Form:** Mind Maelstrom

**Requirement:** Great (20+) Competence → Expertise → Wizardry rank. Before casting, the necromancer must announce the intensified form as intended. To activate, the necromancer must succeed at a d12 challenge die roll, expend 5 Spirit Points, and use a mastery die. The cost includes 1 Spirit Point per target beyond the first. The shadow disperses like a swirling cloud of darkness, impacting all targets within the caster's Expertise MV, measured in feet. Each target suffers non-physical potential harm and must make a Fortitude → Willpower saving throw. On failure, the caster can implant a suggestion, alter a memory, or create an illusion lasting up to 10 minutes per target. During the maintenance of these effects, the caster's other ability tests incur a -4 penalty.

Chapter 10: Story

No player will be happy to produce characters who participate in activities that lack a coherent narrative. Fighting, role-playing, and problem-solving are essential, but there is no flesh for the skeleton without some idea of a plot. Adventures are not intended to push characters into predetermined outcomes, however. How can the GM avoid leading players by their noses? 

Avoiding this problem is simple: adventure plot hooks need to fit the group’s style and expectations. PCs need plausible motivations and goals. Sure, making an interesting adventure is up to the GM, but players are also expected to follow story hooks. Otherwise, why play a fantasy adventure game? The Game Master does not decide each game session’s outcome but instead allows fate and player character decisions to determine outcomes. A good Game Master ensures his players experience a sense of danger without the fear of certain doom and reserves the ability to use or dump rules whenever necessary.

Story Arcs 

Stories generally follow an arc that rises and falls from set-up (background, character objectives), through a build-up (actions and events as characters try to achieve something), to success or failure and then a wrap-up (things are more-or-less resolved). The story unfolds through collaborative storytelling and can be determined by participants’ actions, whether NPC or PC. 

Before any objectives have been decided, the GM should suggest that each character has something in common with the others. For instance, choose one or more of the concepts below to give players the reason for their common bond.

• **Common allegiance to a patron, noble or ecclesiastic.**

**• Compatriots in a network, established adventuring party, or a heroic guild.**

**• The characters are all blood-related or loyal to the same state.**

**• All previously lone adventurers seeking fortune and fame but with a common enemy**.

• Met at the tavern and now friends. Easy enough, although rather uninspired.

Once each player has a common bond in mind, determining their characters’ motivation is easier. But for many fantasy adventures, you do not have to have a more complicated motivation than “get wealth, power, and fame.” 

A goal that encourages all characters to pursue a common quest is important, but remember, they can get boring if things get too predictable. In addition to the expectation of player characters being “open to seeking adventure,” the Game Master should maintain a range of alternatives to determine individual character goals. 

Individual goals may include clearing one’s name for an uncommitted crime, an urge to explore a mythical place, seeking revenge on a nemesis, or thwarting a noble or cult’s evil machinations.

Story Elements

The rising action begins with a strong opening, a plot hook of some kind. The action includes everything you would expect; questing, combat, exploration, role-playing, and problem-solving. 

The rising action of a role-playing game session is a narrative in constant flux. With the right story hook, players will get into the action quickly. 

Key information can be discovered during actual play, as revealed through information gathering and conversations with NPCs.

In any case, the Game Master is wise to limit time length. The structure of fantasy adventures remains relatively constant, despite the game form’s free flow, unpredictable nature. The adventurous heroes complete each milestone, eventually culminating in a single “story-arc.”

There may be many turning points on the road to completing the story, or it could be a simple one-shot with a straightforward mission. 

Heroes gain reputation or disrepute, improve their abilities, store up their present conditions, rest, and reflect on their experiences' impact. 

Then, naturally, trouble finds them again. A final resolution only occurs when players retire their characters, or all heroes are tragically killed. We all hope it is the former situation.

Story Hooks

Plot hooks are incidents designed to propel the characters into the plot’s rising action. Action can consist of a single adventure or several linked scenarios with myriad objectives and obstacles. Problem-solving may be any challenging dilemma, a problematic barrier or terrain, or learning how to thwart the machinations of a recurring and evasive villain. 

There is no reason for action without a good hook! Listed below are various nutshell ideas to lure the adventurers into the plot with the promise of adventure, whether for glory, wealth, or personal motivations. 

Story hooks often involve an NPC, one who entrusts heroes with, pleads with heroes to undertake, or lures heroes toward various possible objectives. This goal could be local monsters' extermination, exploring hazardous locations, questing for legendary artifacts, or rescuing creatures or people of significance.

Common story hooks

• A mission for the player characters asked for by their patron.

• A powerful or important NPC sends out a plea for help.

• There is an ally in trouble.

• A dire threat to the realm.

• Some NPC or monster has a grudge or seeks revenge against the PCs or a person or place important to them.

• NPCs are hindering the progress of the PCs in an overarching way so that they cause them to fail in their overall career as adventurers.

• A mysterious stranger shows up with a mission for the player characters should they choose to accept.

• A mundane message in the proverbial bottle or some mystical and mysterious message that can lead to adventure.

• Rumors and legends with a definite tie-in to the next possible event kicking off an adventure.

• An unexpected attack or ambush against the player characters for reasons they have yet to learn about.

• Unjustified accusations put the player characters on the defense and they must clear their names and discover then defeat the ones who would frame them.

Locales

When building adventures, it is useful to think of a handful of key locations and sketch out the function of each significant encounter in each place. Use the following lists as a brainstorming aid, rolling percentile dice if you wish.

Common Scene Locations

• Castle

• Catacombs

• Caves/Cavern (limestone, volcanic)

• City or Town

• Community

• Donjon (keep tower)

The GM will sketch out some plot-driving contingencies, which require resolving several obstacles before triggering another event. Any story obstacle, hook, or new prospect for adventure can incorporate something that sets other story functions in motion. 

Sometimes, a single action is required before another encounter is triggered, but it is impossible to anticipate all future character actions, so it’s advised that the GM play a narrative shell game with the story elements, moving things around as needed. You may want to create random or even inevitable encounters unbound from planned scenes. 

In such cases, only certain actions, including skill or ability use, lead to encounters with NPCs. 

Below are some common themes for creating conflict and opportunities to move the plot from session to session.

Battle

**Combat Revenge:** A friend or place dear to the hearts of an ally or one of the PCs has been attacked, murdered, or desecrated, or violated. Such an act must be avenged. Skills useful to the task include bluffing (infiltration), disguising oneself (to infiltration), the abilities of an escape artist, forgery (infiltration), gathering information, intimidation, sense motivation.

**Rising Evil:** An NPC or monster has risen as an enemy and must be subdued or killed. Or, a place must be cleared of danger or opposition, down to the last man or beast. Then it must either be occupied, destroyed, or rebuilt. Skills useful to the task include prowess and associated specialties, focus in combat, and tactics.

**Clear Locale:** some dangerous place (a cave or classic dungeon) must be cleared of danger or opposition, down to the last man or beast. Then it must either be occupied, destroyed, or rebuilt. Skills useful to the task include anything related to combat and tactics. Skills and abilities related to combat are always helpful.

Escape

Escaping some locale could be a prerequisite to doing anything (often including sleeping). The PCs have been imprisoned, held hostage or the Locale is doomed by some looming disaster or cataclysmic event. But there are guardians at the gates of freedom, enemies who would see the PCs dead or wish the populace to remain doomed. The escape might be required of the PCs alone, or the heroes could be expected to help the innocent evade harm.

**Useful skills:** balancing (for escaping from precarious places), disabling devices (for bypassing traps), disguising oneself, the abilities of an escape artist, animal handling (for stealing mounts), hiding, jumping (to freedom!), listening (for guards), moving silently, opening locks, riding skill, searching (for keys), sensing motivations of others (for bribes), sleight of hand (for palming objects), general survival skills, swimming, tumbling, and others. 

Explore 

The PCs must explore, survey, and map a place for themselves or their patron. Such exploration is necessary to prevent the party from going astray and getting lost in places where food and other resources are scarce. 

The place could consist of catacombs, caves, ruins, mines, islands, labyrinths, necropolises, trackless wilderness, or similar locations. The expedition’s goal might be to determine whether a viable threat exists and whether rumors and legends of the place are accurate. 

**Useful skills:** balancing, climbing, disabling traps, the skills of an escape artist, jumping, listening, riding, searching, spotting things, general survival skills, and swimming (most actions falling under Prowess → Agility, or Competence → Expertise or Skulduggery).

Investigate 

Some magical, divine, or psionic lore poses a danger to the heroes, their home, or their allies. The threat, typically someone who carries such knowledge and cannot be trusted, must be eliminated. Usually, such an entity is a sage of evil alignment who possesses knowledge that he threatens to employ under the right conditions. 

**Useful skills**: deciphering scripts, forgery, gathering info, sensing motive (will the person possessing the knowledge use it?), sleight of hand (to steal and destroy material knowledge), broadly falling under Competence and Prowess. 

Discover

Perhaps there is a place containing a person, thing, knowledge, or force which must be found and used. But, alas, its location is unknown.

This place could be anywhere: Hallowed and unhallowed ground, fountains of youth, the River Styx, hidden mage towards, lost caves, forgotten ruins, and unmapped places of yore. 

**Useful skills:** knowledge (history, arcane, ancient history, et cetera), gathering info, travel, evaluation, hunt, luck, ranging, mental resistance (to withstand magical emanations or traps), or precision-based abilities for tricks and stealth. 

Spells that discern the truth are helpful. 

Espionage 

Uncover plots and conspiracies, criminal plans, enemy strategies and tactics, troop dispositions, and so on. To go incognito is a must to spy on or infiltrate on the enemy ranks, at least temporarily, whether required of the adventurers or one of their allies. Skills useful to the task include bluffing (avoid detection), disguising oneself (avoid detection), forgery (change identity), sense motivations. 

**Useful skills:** powers of evaluation, one’s Competence → Perception, general scrutiny, adeptness with stealth, roguish tricks, and urbane knowledge.

Seek

The player characters are set on a quest to find a person, place, or thing. Perhaps some powerful artifacts must be found. It could be something used to avert disaster or cataclysm or a symbolic item that has the power to calm social or political strife. Or it could be one piece of a shattered item that must be restored. 

Neutralize Mysterious Evil

It could be that some magical, divine, or psionic items or artifacts threaten the heroes, their home, or their allies. This threat must be eliminated. 

**Useful Skills:** Competence-based actions include appraisal (to detect decoys), divination, crafting (to create decoys), deciphering scripts (to read ancient treasure maps), disabling devices or traps (or else get blown up), specific knowledge (any sort relevant to the item), and searching, the abilities of an escape artist (when the item itself can entrap), general arcane or divine knowledge, and spellcraft to identify magical hazards.

Seek Knowledge

This objective involves hard-won knowledge. It concerns scholarship, so much information or study will be needed. Knowledge must be obscure or esoteric, but information about any profession or craft may be lost. Only the largest number of sages and experts (NPCs only) will access this knowledge. Implied here is the exposing of lies and misinformation.

**Useful Skills:** Deciphering scripts (the truth sometimes is in old documents), diplomacy (people who are liked are more apt to find the truth), disguising oneself (attain truth by infiltration), forgery (to get into places where truth can be found), gathering information (the universal failsafe skill), intimidation, sensing the motivations of others, spot (for visible clues).

Search for Individuals

A known and (as far as is known) living person is missing and must be located. They hold some important item, fact, or expertise required before the final goal can be attained. 

**Useful skills:** diplomacy (to win friends of those who may be protecting their whereabouts), disguising oneself (to fool those who protect the person’s whereabouts), forgery (to seem official when inquiring), gathering info, intimidation (when the person knows the person’s whereabouts but is stubborn), sensing the motivations of others, spot (if the person happens to run by…).

Unravel Mystery

The identity of some mysterious NPC, creature, or supernatural entity must be discovered. Terrible events have been associated with this mysterious figure, a legendary figure, the key to the treasure, etc. 

**Useful skills:** gathering information, sensing others' motivations, and the best magic spells for ferreting out somebody who hides.

Diplomacy Objectives

Adventurers will not only accomplish their goals with sword and spell! In fact, there will be occasions when diplomacy and negotiation will be their most effective weapons. Diplomacy objectives requires that you use your persuasive abilities and knowledge of cultural practices and customs to achieve your objectives. It may be necessary to negotiate peace between warring factions, persuade a recalcitrant NPC to provide information or aid, or convince a ruler to alter a harmful policy.

Diplomacy requires finesse and tact, and those skilled in this art will achieve great success. Only through a profound understanding of the world’s complexities will you be able to successfully navigate its complexities. The addition of diplomacy to your arsenal of skills and abilities will give you a new way to approach challenges in the game, emphasizing the importance of social skills and communication in addition to physical and investigative abilities. 

In this realm, a silver tongue and a keen understanding of others’ motivations will serve thee well. Choose thy words with care, adventurer, for they may prove more potent than weapons! 

Negotiate Peace between Two Warring Kingdoms

Two neighboring kingdoms are on the brink of war, and the player characters have been tasked with negotiating a peace treaty between them. The kingdoms have long-standing grievances against each other, and tensions are high. The player characters must navigate the delicate political situation, gain the trust of both sides, and find a way to broker a lasting peace.

**Useful Skills:** Diplomacy, bluffing, sense motive, knowledge of cultural practices and customs, history, and politics.

Convince a Stubborn Ruler to Change a Harmful Policy

A ruler has implemented a policy that is causing harm to the people in his or her kingdom, but refuses to change it. The player characters must find a way to convince the ruler to alter the policy for the betterment of the realm’s subjects. However, the ruler is known for stubbornness and is unlikely to change his or her mind easily.

**Useful Skills:** Diplomacy, bluffing, sense motive, knowledge of cultural practices and customs, persuasion, and charisma.

Swords, axes, throwing axe

Impaling

Speed (Agility) or Skullduggery (Adroitness)

Rapiers, spears, bows, crossbows, thrown spears

_Note: Iconic Weapons grant +1 threat point per character level when expending a mastery die and may trigger a "master twist" effect if the mastery die rolls a 1. Specialists (Melee or Precision) add their Threat or Ranged Threat focus bonus to potential harm._

### Armor & Shields

**Armor Types & Damage Reduction (DR)**:

**Armor Type**

**Damage Reduction (Die Roll)**

**Notes**

Hide

1d4

Basic protection, like tough skin

Leather

1d6

Moderate protection, akin to scales or armored plates

Chain Mail

1d8

Strong protection, resembling a bony outer layer

Plate Mail

1d10

High-level protection, similar to a heavy outer shell

Magic Armor

1d12

Can increase die-rank or grant a static bonus

_Note: If wearing multiple armor types (e.g., natural armor and worn armor), use the highest die rank for DR, then add +1 per die rank for the secondary armor. Magic armor bonuses can be bypassed. Armor reduces threat points that exceed the defender's active defense._

**Shields & Threat Point Negation**:

**Shield Type**

**Threat Point Negation**

**Notes**

Small Shield

1 threat point

Compact defense; e.g., hardened forearm guard

Medium Shield

2 threat points

Standard protection; e.g., sturdy bone or wood piece

Large Shield

3 threat points

Substantial defense; e.g., large carapace section

_Note: Shields reduce threat points before active defense points are reduced. This reduction applies only if the active defense points are above zero. Magic shields add a static bonus (e.g., a +1 shield reduces threat by 2)._

The Hit Point Modifiers table, which influences a creature's total Hit Points based on its size and nature, is as follows:

**Nature and Size**

**Mundane**

**Magical**

**Preternatural**

**Supernatural**

The Trap Level Table, detailing hazard levels for traps in Eldritch RPG, is presented below:

**Trap Level**

**Description**

**Trap Types**

**Detection**

**Disarm**

**Effect**

**Defense Negation**

Level 1 Low Hazard

Basic mechanical traps

Mechanical

Easy (1d4 to 2d4)

1d4 to 2d4

1d4 to 2d6 threat

Mitigated by Active DP or basic armor

Level 2 Moderate Hazard

More complex mechanical traps

Mechanical

Moderate (2d6)

1d8

2d8 to 3d6 threat

May bypass basic armor but not Active DP

Level 3 Considerable Hazard

Advanced mechanical/magical

Mechanical/Magical

Difficult (2d8)

2d8

3d10 to 4d6 threat

May bypass both armor and Active DP

Level 4 High Hazard

Dangerous magical traps

Magical

Demanding (2d10)

2d10

5d10 to 6d6 threat

Likely to bypass both Active DP and armor

Level 5 Extreme Hazard

Lethal and complex magical traps

Magical

Formidable (2d12)

2d12

6d10+ threat

Bypasses standard defenses

**Notes on the Table:**

- **Detection / Disarm Difficulty:** Uses a two-dice system (e.g., 2d6, 2d8), where the first value is for detection and the second is for disarming. Higher dice values indicate more complex or well-hidden traps.
- **Effect:** Expressed in threat points, indicating the severity of the trap's impact. For continuous harm, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Trap Level.
- **Defense Negation:** Specifies which defenses (e.g., armor or Active Defense Points) are effective against the trap.

The Iconic Weapon Damage Types and Synergies table is as follows:

**Damage Type**

**Associated Focus Bonuses**

**Iconic Weapon Damage Type Synergies**

Crushing

Might (Strength)

Wielding weapons such as warhammers, clubs, maces, or a slingshot.

Slashing

Ferocity (Strength)

Wielding weapons like swords, axes, or a throwing axe.

Impaling

Speed (Agility) or Skulduggery (Adroitness) for Rogues

Wielding weapons such as rapiers, spears, bows, crossbows, or thrown spears.

Because the **initial build CPs** (free allocations + 10 bonus customization) don’t count toward advancement, a 5th‑level Human Mage would still need to **earn a full 500 CPs** _after_ creation to reach Level 5.

Here’s how it plays out step by step:

## Earned CPs for Level Advancement (Mage Example)

**Level**

**Total CP Value Band**

**Earned CPs Required**

1

30–100

0 (all initial build is free/bonus)

2

101–199

100 earned CP

3

200–299

200 earned CP

4

300–399

300 earned CP

5

400–500+

500 earned CP

### Key Point

Even though a “snapshot” character sheet for a Level 5 Mage might _look_ like it has ~470–490 CPs worth of abilities, those are **not cumulative from Level 1 onward** in play terms.

- The **Total CP Value** is a static reflection of balance.
- The **Earned CP Ledger** is a running tally the player keeps from _zero at Rookie_.

Thus, to stand as a legitimate **Level 5 Mage in play**, the character must earn **500 CPs over time** through adventures, regardless of what their build’s CP total shows.
